Location of all the 14 [eight-thousanders](/wiki/Eight-thousanders)

**Alan Hinkes**[OBE](/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire) (born 26 April 1954) is an [English](/wiki/England) Himalayan high-altitude [mountaineer](/wiki/Mountaineering) from [Northallerton](/wiki/Northallerton) in [North Yorkshire](/wiki/North_Yorkshire). He is the first British mountaineer to claim all 14 Himalayan [eight-thousanders](/wiki/Eight-thousander) (mountains above 8,000 m (26,247 ft) in height), a feat he completed on 30 May 2005.

14 Eight-thousanders
--------------------

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alan_Hinkes&action=edit&section=1)]
### British record

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alan_Hinkes&action=edit&section=2)]

Hinkes is the first British mountaineer to claim to have summited all 14 mountains with elevations above 8,000 metres (26,247 ft), known as the [eight-thousanders](/wiki/Eight-thousander), when he summited [Kangchenjunga](/wiki/Kangchenjunga) on 30 May 2005, aged 50 years and 34 days.[[1]](#cite_note-end-1)[[2]](#cite_note-2)[[3]](#cite_note-bmc1-3)[[4]](#cite_note-alp1-4)[[5]](#cite_note-5)

It was first achieved by [Reinhold Messner](/wiki/Reinhold_Messner) in 1986 (all without oxygen), and two decades later, Hinkes was only the 13th person to claim the feat, days after U.S. climber [Ed Viesturs](/wiki/Ed_Viesturs) became the 12th person on 22 May 2005.[[6]](#cite_note-6)

It is a rare feat, as the ratio of deaths to summits on several [eight-thousanders](/wiki/Eight-thousander) is at one-in-five ([Annapurna](/wiki/Annapurna), [K2](/wiki/K2), [Nanga Parbat](/wiki/Nanga_Parbat), [Kangchenjunga](/wiki/Kangchenjunga)).[[7]](#cite_note-dead1-7)[[8]](#cite_note-dead2-8) This should not be interpreted as meaning that a "death-rate" is circa 20%, as the statistic ignores the number of attempts (and also partial attempts, and/or route stocking activity etc.). However, given that climbing the [eight-thousanders](/wiki/Eight-thousander) requires multiple failed attempts (Hinkes took two attempts on average), and the most failures are usually on the most dangerous mountains, the risk of death in attempting all 14 [eight-thousanders](/wiki/Eight-thousander) is material.

Hinkes took 26 attempts to climb the 14 [eight-thousanders](/wiki/Eight-thousander) (not counting his ascent of [Shishapangma](/wiki/Shishapangma) Central (West) in 1990), giving a first attempt success rate of circa 54%. Hinkes spent 21 years on his "Challenge 8000", starting with his ascent of [Shishapangma](/wiki/Shishapangma) in 1987, and ending with his ascent of [Kangchenjunga](/wiki/Kangchenjunga) in 2005. Hinkes is recorded as summiting [Mount Everest](/wiki/Mount_Everest) on 19 May 1996.[[9]](#cite_note-9)

### Observations

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alan_Hinkes&action=edit&section=3)]

He regards [K2](/wiki/K2) as the hardest [eight-thousander](/wiki/Eight-thousander) mountain ("an easy place to die"), which he climbed on his third attempt (he abandoned his first attempt, when closing in on the summit, to rescue a stricken Swedish climber).[[10]](#cite_note-ah1-10) He ranks [Kanchenjunga](/wiki/Kanchenjunga) as the second hardest [eight-thousander](/wiki/Eight-thousander) mountain, which he also climbed on his third attempt.[[11]](#cite_note-aj2-11)

As an [eight-thousander](/wiki/Eight-thousander) climber, Hinkes has encountered death on his own expeditions, and on neighbouring expeditions. Several of his climbing partners subsequently died on mountains. A particular death that Hinkes notes was fellow U.K. climbing partner, [Alison Hargreaves](/wiki/Alison_Hargreaves), who died on [K2](/wiki/K2) in 1995, weeks after Hinkes had summited [K2](/wiki/K2).[[12]](#cite_note-aj-12)[[13]](#cite_note-al-13)

Hinkes had to be air rescued from [Nanga Parbat](/wiki/Nanga_Parbat) in July 1997 when flour from a burnt [chapati](/wiki/Chapati) got up his nose, making him sneeze so violently that he prolapsed a disc. He had to wait 10 days in agony before being rescued and brought to Islamabad for treatment. He has been referred to as the "chapati man" (even by himself) from this incident.[[14]](#cite_note-14)[[15]](#cite_note-guar-15)[[12]](#cite_note-aj-12)

Hinkes has climbed [eight-thousanders](/wiki/Eight-thousander) in many styles: expeditions ([Cho Oyu](/wiki/Cho_Oyu), [Manaslu](/wiki/Manaslu), [Nanga Parbat](/wiki/Nanga_Parbat)), two-man alpine ([Makalu](/wiki/Makalu), [Dhaulagiri](/wiki/Dhaulagiri)) and alone ([Gasherbrum I](/wiki/Gasherbrum_I), [Gasherbrum II](/wiki/Gasherbrum_II)), and permutations in between. He has climbed new lines ([Shishapangma](/wiki/Shishapangma), [Kangchenjunga](/wiki/Kangchenjunga), [Annapurna](/wiki/Annapurna)), he has climbed as guide ([Broad Peak](/wiki/Broad_Peak)), as camera man ([Everest](/wiki/Everest)), and set speed records ([Annapurna](/wiki/Annapurna)).[[16]](#cite_note-ana-16) He has climbed several on first attempt, others on third ([Nanga Parbat](/wiki/Nanga_Parbat)) and fourth attempt ([Makalu](/wiki/Makalu)). He has climbed with well-known mountaineers, including several expeditions with [Doug Scott](/wiki/Doug_Scott)[[11]](#cite_note-aj2-11) and [Chris Bonington](/wiki/Chris_Bonington).[[17]](#cite_note-chris-17)

He describes himself as risk-averse ("I climb to live, not to die", "The summit is optional, getting down is mandatory"),[[18]](#cite_note-book-18)[[15]](#cite_note-guar-15) who places value on understanding, and being in the right position, to capitalise on breaks in weather. His later climbs were mostly two-man climbs with experienced sherpas (Pasang Gelu), where Hinkes could stay in control of events and react quickly. He was not averse to leveraging the resources of bigger expeditions alongside. Unusually for a 20–year high-altitude Himalayan [eight-thousander](/wiki/Eight-thousander), he has never lost any fingers or toes (or "other bits" as he describes it), to frostbite.[[19]](#cite_note-19)

Over the years, Hinkes has had public arguments with other chasers of the 14 [eight-thousanders](/wiki/Eight-thousanders). Australian climber [Andrew Lock](/wiki/Andrew_Lock) (who completed all 14 in 2009), was critical of Hinkes on their successful 1998 ascent of [Nanga Parbat](/wiki/Nanga_Parbat).[[20]](#cite_note-20) Spanish climber [Iñaki Ochoa de Olza](/wiki/I%C3%B1aki_Ochoa_de_Olza), (who died on [Annapurna](/wiki/Annapurna) of [pulmonary edema](/wiki/High_altitude_pulmonary_edema), after completing 12 [eight thousanders](/wiki/Eight_thousanders) without oxygen), alleges that Hinkes had left him to bleed to death in order to summit K2, which Hinkes countered was factually untrue[[21]](#cite_note-tele-21) (Hinkes abandoned his first K2 climb, despite nearing the summit, to successfully rescue a stricken Swedish climber).[[10]](#cite_note-ah1-10)

Cho Oyu dispute
---------------

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alan_Hinkes&action=edit&section=4)][![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Cho_Oyu_upper_slopes.jpg/220px-Cho_Oyu_upper_slopes.jpg)](/wiki/File:Cho_Oyu_upper_slopes.jpg)

**[Cho Oyu](/wiki/Cho_Oyu):** Showing the route from camp III at 7,500 m (24,606 ft), which crosses the "yellow bands", to get to the final flat summit plateau.

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Carlos_pauner_Chooyu01.jpg/220px-Carlos_pauner_Chooyu01.jpg)](/wiki/File:Carlos_pauner_Chooyu01.jpg)

**[Carlos Pauner](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Pauner):** The Spanish mountaineer recording his 5th official [eight-thousander](/wiki/Eight-thousander), on the plateau of Cho Oyu, at the "prayer flags" with "view of everest" (the [Elizabeth Hawley](/wiki/Elizabeth_Hawley) criteria[[22]](#cite_note-cho-22)), but circa 15 mins away from the "technical" summit.[[23]](#cite_note-summit-23)

His 30 April 1990 ascent of [Cho Oyu](/wiki/Cho_Oyu), which he completed alone in low visibility, is disputed by one observer.[[24]](#cite_note-scot-24) Cho Oyu has a broadly flat summit plateau with no [cairn](/wiki/Cairn) (the traditional [prayer flags](/wiki/Prayer_flag) on Cho Oyu's summit plateau do not mark the "technical" summit).[[23]](#cite_note-summit-23) The summit is a small unmarked "hump" (or "bump")[[22]](#cite_note-cho-22) (which many Cho Oyu YouTube summit videos miss).[[25]](#cite_note-25)[[26]](#cite_note-26) While the height differential of this hump is small, [Ralf Dujmovits](/wiki/Ralf_Dujmovits), 3-time Cho Oyu summiter, notes that for a strong climber to get to the "hump" area can take another 30 minutes.[[22]](#cite_note-cho-22)

The source of the dispute was that Himalayan chronicler [Elizabeth Hawley](/wiki/Elizabeth_Hawley), whose *[Himalayan Database](/wiki/The_Himalayan_Database)* is used by online databases like AdventureStats,[[27]](#cite_note-hdb-27) "unrecognised" his Cho Oyu ascent in Spring 2005 (15 years after summiting).[[28]](#cite_note-liz-28)[Hawley](/wiki/Elizabeth_Hawley) based her decision on an interview with Hinkes, and on other team members.[[29]](#cite_note-bmcx-29) Hawley agrees Hinkes reached the summit plateau (as does [Eberhard Jurgalski's](/w/index.php?title=Eberhard_Jurgalski&action=edit&redlink=1) [[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberhard_Jurgalski)] list[[30]](#cite_note-edw-30)), but questions how Hinkes could have been on the “technical” summit for certain, if he could not see it.

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Elitzabeth_Hawley_Card.jpg/160px-Elitzabeth_Hawley_Card.jpg)](/wiki/File:Elitzabeth_Hawley_Card.jpg)

**[Elizabeth Hawley](/wiki/Elizabeth_Hawley):** The influential Himalayan chronicler decided, years after Hinkes' climb, not to accept his view; she remains the only publicly verifiable source of dispute on Hinkes' climb. She died in 2018.[[28]](#cite_note-liz-28)

> But his claim to have now climbed all 8000ers is open to question. In April 1990 he and others reached the summit plateau of Cho Oyu. It was misty so they could not see well; nine years later Hinkes said he had “wandered around for a while” in the summit area but could see very little and eventually descended to join the others, one of whom said they had not reached the top.
> 
> — [Elizabeth Hawley](/wiki/Elizabeth_Hawley), "Seasonal Stories", page 347, Spring 2005[[28]](#cite_note-liz-28)

Hinkes logged the expedition's 30 April 1990 Cho Oyu ascent in the 1991 *[American Alpine Journal](/wiki/American_Alpine_Journal)* (*AAJ*), as well as the expedition's ascent of [Shishapangma](/wiki/Shishapangma) 12 days later on 12 May 1990, but he notes they climbed [Shishapangma](/wiki/Shishapangma)'s central (west) summit (the true summit is circa two hours further on).[[31]](#cite_note-31) Hawley's biography notes French expedition leader [Benoît Chamoux](/wiki/Beno%C3%AEt_Chamoux) "unhappy with this, as she did not credit Chamoux with [Shishapangma](/wiki/Shishapangma) either" (Hawley had compelled the famous Himalayan mountaineer [Ed Viesturs](/wiki/Ed_Viesturs) to re-climb [Shishapangma](/wiki/Shishapangma) for the same reason, which he did).[[32]](#cite_note-32) Hinkes would not climb with Benoît Chamoux, or any of the French team members, again.

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Josef_Rakoncaj.jpg/220px-Josef_Rakoncaj.jpg)](/wiki/File:Josef_Rakoncaj.jpg)

**Josef Rakoncaj:** Czech Himalayan mountaineer photographed Hinkes' on the summit plateau of Cho Oyu in 1990 and claims the ascent

Hawley does not use the public accounts of the non-French team members. Czech team member [Josef Rakoncaj](/wiki/Josef_Rakoncaj) photographed Hinkes on the summit plateau of Cho Oyu (Hinkes with his usual photo of his daughter held out), and states Hinkes summited in his book "Na hrotech zeměkoule" (co-authored with Miloš Jasanský, 1993).[[33]](#cite_note-33) Italian team member Mauro Rossi lists the 1990 ascent of Cho Oyu in his public resume.[[34]](#cite_note-34) Climbers with several Cho Oyu ascents, have disputed Hawley's main Cho Oyu summit criteria, "Did you see Everest?" (which is obviously unhelpful in Hinkes' case given the poor visibility), and the incorrect behaviours it is creating.[[22]](#cite_note-cho-22)

Hawley's *[Himalayan Database](/wiki/The_Himalayan_Database)* records 3,681 ascents of [Cho Oyu](/wiki/Cho_Oyu) of which 18 are "unrecognised" since 1960,[[27]](#cite_note-hdb-27) despite the difficulty of finding Cho Oyu's "technical" summit, and that older expeditions considered the summit plateau as sufficient.[[22]](#cite_note-cho-22) Chamoux's 1990 Cho Oyu expedition comprise seven of these "unrecognised" ascents (including Alan Hinkes), while a German commercial trekking expedition, led by Günther Härter, who summited Cho Oyu just 19 days after Chamoux in 1990 (and also in very low visibility, as recorded by the Germans[[35]](#cite_note-35)), comprise another six.[[27]](#cite_note-hdb-27)[[36]](#cite_note-36)

The dispute is noted in many Hinkes interviews.[[37]](#cite_note-37)[[38]](#cite_note-38)[[39]](#cite_note-39)[[15]](#cite_note-guar-15) He highlights the lack of any evidence, or publicly verifiable sources, for the allegation,[[40]](#cite_note-ah2-40) and he is supported by the *[Alpine Journal](/wiki/Alpine_Journal)*,[[4]](#cite_note-alp1-4) and the [British Mountaineering Council](/wiki/British_Mountaineering_Council) (BMC).[[3]](#cite_note-bmc1-3) Hinkes says he spent "at least an hour and a half" criss-crossing the flat summit plateau, alone, until he "was sure there was no more uphill".[[24]](#cite_note-scot-24)[[18]](#cite_note-book-18)[Hawley](/wiki/Elizabeth_Hawley)'s "Seasonal Stories" suggest an aversion to Hinkes,[[41]](#cite_note-41) and her biography lists Alan Hinkes as a climber "she did not like".[[42]](#cite_note-42)

> I spent at least an hour and a half covering every inch of ground on the summit plateau until, in the end, I was absolutely certain that I could not get any higher. There was no more uphill.
> 
> — Alan Hinkes, "Alan Hinkes on climbing the world's highest mountains", *[The Scotsman](/wiki/The_Scotsman)*, 9 November 2013[[24]](#cite_note-scot-24)

AdventureStats.com record 8,000m ascents not independently verified. Their website ("Verifications and Disputes") states that unless given written proof otherwise, "No proof other than the explorer's word is required",[[43]](#cite_note-adventure-43) implying they give credit to Hawley's unverified allegations.[[44]](#cite_note-adv-44) It contrasts, for example, with Hawley, AdventureStats, and [Eberhard Jurgalski](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberhard_Jurgalski)'s,[[45]](#cite_note-45) acceptance of [Denis Urubko](/wiki/Denis_Urubko)'s acclaimed 2009 ascent of Cho Oyu's Southeast face (and his 14th official [eight-thousander](/wiki/Eight-thousander)), who reached the Cho Oyu summit plateau in the dark and in a snowstorm, per his summit photo from his *AAJ* log.[[46]](#cite_note-den-46) (ascent number 2785 on Hawley's Himalayan Database).[[27]](#cite_note-hdb-27)

The paragraph in Elizabeth Hawley's 2005 *Seasonal Stories*[[28]](#cite_note-liz-28) remains the only publicly verifiable source of the dispute over Hinkes' Cho Oyu ascent. No climbing journal disputes Hinkes' ascent, and some publicly support it.[[4]](#cite_note-alp1-4) However, Hawley retains a well-earned stature as a Himalayan chronicler, and her *[Himalayan Database](/wiki/The_Himalayan_Database)* is the source for most online Himalayan ascent databases (e.g. AdventureStats). Hawley passed away in 2018.

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Alan_Hinkes&action=edit&section=5)]

In January 2006, after [Kangchenjunga](/wiki/Kangchenjunga), Hinkes was awarded an [OBE](/wiki/Officer_of_the_British_Empire) in the [2006 New Year Honours](/wiki/2006_New_Year_Honours) List for his achievements in mountaineering.[[47]](#cite_note-47) He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the [University of Sunderland](/wiki/University_of_Sunderland) in 1999, and an Honorary Doctorate from the [University of York](/wiki/University_of_York) in 2007. He was awarded Yorkshire Man of the Year in 2005,[[48]](#cite_note-48) and was made an honorary citizen of his hometown [Northallerton](/wiki/Northallerton) in the same year.[[49]](#cite_note-49)

Hinkes is an avid photographer and released a photographic essay book in October 2013 called *8000 Metres Climbing the World's Highest Mountains*. He is the subject of an October 2017 documentary by filmmaker, Terry Abraham, *Alan Hinkes: The First Briton To Climb The World's Highest Mountains*. Hinkes has frequently appeared on British television over the years, particularly regarding Himalayan events/stories, including [BBC News](/wiki/BBC_News), [Sky News](/wiki/Sky_News), *[Newsnight](/wiki/Newsnight)* etc.

Hinkes started life as a geography and PE teacher, which he abandoned to concentrate on climbing. He never married but has a daughter, Fiona, whose picture (with her son, Jay), Hinkes displays in most summit photographs.[[15]](#cite_note-guar-15)
