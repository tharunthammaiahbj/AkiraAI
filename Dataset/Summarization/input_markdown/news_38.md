The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [reported](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/norostat-data-table.html#cdc_generic_section_2-table-notes) double the cases of norovirus compared to previous years in early December after outbreaks have been reported across the country.

During the week of Dec. 5, the CDC reported [91 cases of norovirus](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/norostat-data-table.html#cdc_generic_section_2-table-notes), more commonly known as the stomach flu, which is over double the highest number recorded between 2021 and 2024.

The report comes after a Minnesota Department of Health press [release](https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2024/norovirus122324.html) stating Minnesota saw double the average number cases of stomach flu in December.

As cases increase, here's what to know about norovirus.

Norovirus is more commonly known as the stomach flu, and is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea from inflammation of the stomach and intestines, or gastroenteritis, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html).

The virus is also the number one cause of foodborne illness in the U.S. and causes 58% of the illnesses acquired.

--------------------------------------------------------

[Over 80 people](/story/news/nation/2024/12/20/norovirus-oysters-people-sick-la-times-event/77104061007/) at an event in Los Angeles were also reported to have been made sick this month after eating oysters at the Los Angeles Times 101 Best Restaurants event, USA TODAY previously reported.

[Oysters](/story/money/food/2024/12/19/norovirus-oysters-clams-fda/77089674007/) from British Columbia, Canada were also recalled after the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued](https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/fda-advises-restaurants-and-retailers-not-serve-or-sell-and-consumers-not-eat-certain-oysters-2) multiple advisories warning people that the shellfish could be contaminated with the virus.

Outbreaks of norovirus have also been found on multiple cruise ships this month.

Last week, 83 guests and a dozen crew members on a Holland American Line cruise [reported being ill](/story/travel/cruises/2024/12/20/holland-america-norovirus-outbreak-rotterdam/77104054007/) on a voyage that departed Fort Lauderdale Dec. 8 and ended Dec. 20. Their main symptoms were vomiting and diarrhea.

The outbreak followed a separate norovirus outbreaks on Princess Cruises’ [Ruby Princess](/story/travel/cruises/2024/12/19/ruby-princess-cruise-norovirus-outbreak/77086015007/) in a voyage that ended Dec. 18 and a cruise on [Holland America’s Zuiderdam](/story/travel/cruises/2024/12/13/holland-america-norovirus-outbreak-zuiderdam/76961798007/) that ended Dec. 14.

How does norovirus spread?
--------------------------

* Consuming foods or drinks contaminated with the virus
* Being in close contact with an infected person
* Touching their mouth or nose after touching contaminated surfaces

People are more likely to spread the virus to people with whom they share food or utensils, or people with whom they have close contact or are caring for.

While the virus can be contracted at any time of the year, it is most commonly spread from November to April, according to the CDC. During the years when a new strain of the virus, there are 50% more cases of the illness.

The CDC [advises](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html) those sick with the virus to stay hydrated and drink fluids often. Sports drinks, like Gatorade or Body Armor, can help with rehydration, but may not replenish nutrients and minerals the way oral rehydration fluids, like Pedialyte, can.

Do not take any antibiotics, as they won't treat the virus, according to the CDC.
