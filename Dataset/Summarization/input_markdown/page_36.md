Businesses capture a tremendous amount of data during daily activities that's supports valuable business intelligence (BI) for decision makers:

* Sales figures
* Purchases
* Operational expenses
* Employee salaries
* Budgets

Business Central contains many features to help you gather, analyze, and share your organization's finance data:

* Financial reporting (for financial statements and KPIs)
* Power BI reports for finance
* Ad-hoc analysis on lists
* Ad-hoc analysis of data in Excel (using open in Excel)
* Built-in finance reports

Each of these features has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. To learn more, go to [Analytics, business intelligence, and reporting overview](reports-bi-reporting).

This article introduces you can use these analytical features to provide financial insights.

Analytics needs in finance
--------------------------

When thinking of analytics needs in finance, it might help to use a mental model based on personas described on a high-level and their different analytics needs.

[![](/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg)](/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas.svg#lightbox)

People in different roles have different needs when it comes to data, and they use the data in different ways. For example, people in finance interact with data differently than people in sales.

[![](/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg)](/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/media/analytics-personas-scenarios.svg#lightbox)

Using Power BI to monitor financial statements and KPIs
-------------------------------------------------------

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a measurable value that shows how effectively you’re meeting your goals. In finance, people often use the following KPIs to monitor their organization's financial health:

* Net Profit Margin
* Gross Profit Margin
* Current/Quick/Cash Ratio
* COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
* Debt-to-Equity Ratio
* Current/Payroll/Longterm Liabilities
* Operating Profit - EBIT
* EBITDA
* Average Collection Period (Days)

[![](media/finance/financial-overview.png)](media/finance/financial-overview.png#lightbox)

These financial KPIs, and more, are available in the Power BI Finance app for Business Central. To learn more, go to [Power BI finance app](finance-powerbi-app).

The following table describes the reports in the Power BI Finance app, and how you can use them.

 Tip

You can easily track the KPIs that the Power BI reports display against your business objectives. To learn more, go to [Track your business KPIs with Power BI metrics](track-kpis-with-power-bi-metrics).

Using Financial Reporting to produce financial statements and KPIs
------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Financial Reporting** feature gives you insights into the financial data shown on your chart of accounts (COA). You can set up financial reports to analyze figures in general ledger (G/L) accounts, and compare general ledger entries with budget entries. The results display in charts and reports on your home page, such as the Cash Flow chart, and the Income Statement and Balance Sheet reports.

Dimensions play an important role in business intelligence. A dimension is data that you can add to an entry as a parameter. Dimensions let you group entries that have similar characteristics so they're easier to analyze. For example, customers, regions, products, and salespersons. Among other purposes, use dimensions when you define analysis views and create financial reports. Learn more at [Work with Dimensions](finance-dimensions).

 Tip

As a quick way to analyze transactional data, you can filter totals in the chart of accounts and all entries in **Entries** pages by dimensions. Look for the **Set Dimension Filter** action.

The following table describes a sequence of tasks in financial reporting, with links to the articles that describe them.

Finance reporting across business units or legal entities
---------------------------------------------------------

Some organizations use Business Central in multiple business units or legal entities. Others use Business Central in subsidiaries that must report into parent organizations. Business Central gives accountants tools that help them transfer general ledger entries from two or more companies (subsidiaries) into a consolidated company.

To learn more, go to [Company consolidation](finance-consolidated-company-reporting).

Ad-hoc analysis of finance data
-------------------------------

Sometimes, you just need to check whether the numbers add up correctly, or quickly confirm a figure. The following features are great for ad-hoc analyses:

* Data analysis on ledger list pages
* Open in Excel

The Data analysis feature lets you open almost a list page, such as General Ledger Entries, Fixed Asset Ledger Entries, Check Ledger Entries, or Bank Account Ledger Entries, enter analysis mode, and then group, filter, and pivot data as you see fit.

[![](media/data-analysis-gl-entries.png)](media/data-analysis-gl-entries.png#lightbox)

Similarly, you can use the **Open in Excel** action to open a list page for ledger entries, optionally filter the list to a subset of the data, and then use Excel to work with the data. For example, by using features such as Excel Copilot, Analyze Data, What-If Analysis, or Forecast Sheet.

[![](media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png)](media/open-in-excel-gl-entries.png#lightbox)

 Tip

If you configure OneDrive for system features, the Excel workbook opens in your browser by using Excel for the web.

For more information on how to do ad-hoc analysis on ledgers, see [Ad hoc analysis on finance data](ad-hoc-analysis-finance).

Built-in reports for finance
----------------------------

Business Central includes several built-in reports, tracing functions, and tools to help auditors or controllers who are responsible for reporting to the finance department.

To get an overview of available reports, you can choose **All reports** on the top pane of your home page. This action opens the Role Explorer, which is filtered to the features in the **Report & Analysis** option. To learn more, go to [Finding Reports with the Role Explorer](ui-role-explorer).

[![](media/report-explorer-finance.png)](media/report-explorer-finance.png#lightbox)

Built-in reports come in two flavors:

* Designed for print (pdf).
* Designed for analysis in Excel.

For more information, see these overviews for reports that are relevant for finance.

* [Built-in finance Excel reports](finance-analyze-excel)
* [Built-in key finance reports](finance-reports)
* [Built-in fixed assets reports](fa-reports)
* [Built-in accounts receivable reports](receivables-reports)
* [Built-in accounts payable reports](payables-reports)

On-screen finance task pages
----------------------------

Business Central has several pages that give you financial overviews and tasks to do.

### Show general ledger entries and balances from the Chart of Accounts page

The Chart of Accounts page shows all general ledger accounts with aggregated numbers posted to the general ledger. From this page, you can do things like:

* View reports that show general ledger entries and balances.
* Review a list of posting groups for that account.
* View separate debit and credit balances for a single account.

[![](media/chart-of-accounts-page.png)](media/chart-of-accounts-page.png#lightbox)

To learn more, go to [Understand the Chart of Accounts](finance-general-ledger#the-chart-of-accounts).

### View actual amounts compared to budgeted amounts for all accounts and for several periods

As a part of gathering, analyzing, and sharing your company data, you might want to view actual amounts compared to budgeted amounts for all accounts and for several periods. You can make this comparison from the **Chart of Accounts** page, by choosing the **G/L Balance/Budget** action.

To learn more, go to [Analyze Actual Amounts Versus Budgeted Amounts](bi-how-analyze-actual-versus-budget).

### Analyze data by dimensions

Dimensions are values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.

So, instead of setting up separate general ledger accounts for each department and project, you can use dimensions as a basis for analysis and avoid having to create a complicated chart of accounts structure.

In financial analysis, a dimension is data you add to a G/L entry as a kind of marker. This data is used to group G/L entries with similar characteristics, such as customers, regions, products, and salesperson, and easily retrieve these groups for analysis. You can use dimensions on entries in journals, documents, and budgets. For more information, see [Analyze Data by Dimensions](bi-how-analyze-data-dimension)

### Analyzing cash flow

On the Accountant home page, under **Finance Performance**, the Cash Cycle, Cash Flow, and Income & Expense charts offer ways to analyze cash flow:

* Review figures for a period by using the timeline slider.
* Filter the chart by choosing the source in the legend.
* Change the length of the period, or go to the previous or next period, by choosing options on the Finance Performance drop down.

[![](media/cashflow-accountant-rolecentre.png)](media/cashflow-accountant-rolecentre.png#lightbox)

To examine the forecast, in addition to forecast entries, you can also look at the cash flow worksheet. For example, you can see how the forecast:

* Handles confirmed sales and purchases.
* Subtracts payables and adds receivables.
* Skips duplicate sales orders and purchase orders.

To learn more, go to [Analyzing Cash Flow in Your Company](finance-analyze-cash-flow).
