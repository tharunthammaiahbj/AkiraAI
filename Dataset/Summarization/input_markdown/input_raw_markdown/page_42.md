2. [See also](#see-also)

You might sometimes have to handle payments to your bank account that can't be applied to a related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry. Reasons might be that no document exists in Business Central that the payment can be applied to, or the related document in Business Central has a different amount than the transaction amount, for example, because of currency exchange. On the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page, all transaction amounts for payments that aren't yet applied appear in the **Difference** field, including amounts that can't be applied because of reasons such as the above.

The methods for resolving these types of unapplied payments:

* Apply manually
* Use text-to-account mapping
* Transfer an excess amount to a journal line to create and post the required entry, such as a refund of an overpayment.

Payments that can't be applied can appear on payment reconciliation journal lines in the following different ways:

* The value in the **Difference** field is equal to the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, which indicates that no part of the payment can be applied to a related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry.
* The value in the **Difference** field is lower than the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, which indicates that a part of the payment can be applied to a related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry. The remaining part of the payment can't be applied and must be reconciled manually or by posting it directly to an account.

To reconcile such payments, you can choose the **Transfer Difference to Account** action and then specify to which account the amount in the **Difference** field will be posted when you post the payment reconciliation journal. You can do this either from the **Payment Reconciliation Journal** page or from the **Payment Application Review** page that you open by choosing the value in the **Match Confidence** field or by choosing the **Difference** field.

 Tip

Similar functionality exists to set up automatic reconciliation of recurring payments that cannot be applied to related open customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entries. For more information, see [Map Text on Recurring Payments to Accounts for Automatic Reconciliation](receivables-how-map-text-recurring-payments-accounts-auto-reconcilliation).

To reconcile payments that can't be applied automatically
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Choose the ![](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon, enter **Payment Reconciliation Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open a payment reconciliation journal. For more information, see [Reconcile Payments Using Automatic Application](receivables-how-reconcile-payments-auto-application).
3. Choose the **Transfer Difference to Account**. The **Transfer Difference to Account** page opens.
4. In the **Account Type** field, specify if the type of account that the payment amount will be posted to.
5. In the **Account No.** field, specify the account that the payment amount will be posted to.
6. In the **Description** field, specify text that describes this direct payment posting. By default, the text in the **Transaction Text** field on the payment reconciliation journal line is inserted.
7. Choose the **OK** button.

If the value in the **Difference** field was equal to the value in the **Transaction Amount** field when you post the payment reconciliation journal, the whole payment on the journal line will be posted directly to the specified balancing account.

If the value in the **Difference** field was lower than the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, then an additional journal line will be created with the same text and date and with the difference inserted in the **Transaction Amount** field. On the original journal line, the difference will be deducted from the value in the **Transaction Amount** field, and the payment will remain applied to its related customer, vendor, or bank account ledger entry. When you post the payment reconciliation journal, one part of the payment will be posted as an applied payment. The other part of the payment will be posted directly to the specified account.
