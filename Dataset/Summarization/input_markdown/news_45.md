Triphala is an important component of Ayurveda (traditional Indian) medicine. It is made up of three fruits: Amla, Haritaki, and Bibhitaki. It is typically prepared as a tea, but you can also find it in tablet, liquid, and capsule forms. Traditionally, triphala is used to fight a range of issues, from intestinal problems like gas and constipation to immune system problems like inflammation. Many of these uses are not scientifically proven, however, so it is best to talk with a doctor before using triphala, particularly if you are taking other medications.

### Choosing a Form and Dose

Both of these traditional forms can be purchased online or from natural health stores. To prepare the tea, stir a half teaspoon (2.5 g) of the powder into a cup of hot water. Alternatively, you can combine the same amount of powder with honey or ghee and take it before a meal.[[1]](#_note-1)X[Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed CentralJournal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health[Go to source](#)

Choose one of these if you find it convenient. Check the package instructions to determine the dosage equivalent to a traditional form of triphala.
   * To use the liquid supplements, you usually stir 30 drops into a cup of water or juice 1-3 times per day.
   * Capsules, tablets, or chewables should be taken once or twice a day.Advertisement

Then take another before your evening meal. However, if you are taking triphala for digestive benefits, such as a laxative or digestive tonic, have a dose in the evening, about 2 hours after eating dinner or about 30 minutes before going to bed.
   * Taking triphala on an empty stomach is the traditional recommendation. This probably helps maximize the effects of the medicine.

This ensures that you get its full benefits.

If possible, take triphala in its dried fruit form or prepare as a tea. Then take 1 to 3 grams (about 0.25 to 0.5 teaspoons) of it each day.[[2]](#_note-2)XResearch source
   * If you want to use triphala as a laxative, take 2 to 6 grams (0.071 to 0.21 oz) (about 0.4 to 1.25 teaspoons) each day.
   * Triphala will take 6-12 hours to have its laxative effect. Don’t use it as a laxative for more than 7 days.

Just take 2 to 6 g of the dried fruit each day until the problem clears up! You can also sip a cup of triphala tea for soothing relief.

Traditionally, triphala is thought to improve your immune system and keep you healthy in general.[[3]](#_note-3)XResearch source
   * You can take triphala in other forms to receive its immune benefits as well.

Talk to your doctor to determine the right dosage for your condition, and to discuss whether or not triphala will interact with other medications you may be taking for your condition.[[4]](#_note-4)XResearch source

If you are taking any other medications for cholesterol, however, talk to a doctor before starting with triphala.[[5]](#_note-5)XResearch source

However, research on this effect is inconclusive. If you have cancer, you can ask your doctor whether or not they think triphala is potentially a safe and effective option.[[6]](#_note-6)XResearch source
   * Triphala should not replace conventional cancer treatments.

In addition, triphala’s powerful laxative properties may make these symptoms worse. For this reason, it’s best to double-check with a doctor before taking the medicine.

Its effects can severely irritate these conditions as well as:
   * Intestinal blockage
   * Atonic bowel
   * Appendicitis
   * Rectal bleeding
   * Dehydration

Even though triphala is a natural, fruit-based product, it does have potent medicinal properties. This means that it can impact your pregnancy or the health of your child. If your doctor thinks it’s ok for you to take triphala, they can help you come up with a safe dosing strategy.

If you do, try reducing the dose, or stop taking triphala entirely.

After taking triphala for 10 weeks, stop taking it for 2-3 weeks. Then, you can resume your daily regimen of taking triphala. This helps ensure that the remedy is as effective as possible.

Triphala is a tea or tablet made from fruit that's used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat intestinal problems and immune system issues. To prepare Triphala tea, stir 1/2 teaspoon of Triphala powder into 1 cup of hot water. You can also stir the same amount of powder into some honey or ghee and take it before a meal. For the liquid supplement, stir 30 drops into a cup of water or juice 1 to 3 times per day. Take capsules, tablets, or chewables once or twice a day. Take Triphala on an empty stomach to maximize the effects of the medicine. For more tips from our Medical co-author, including how to know if you have a condition that will keep you from taking Triphala, keep reading!
