When you receive a cash payment from a customer or give a cash refund, you can apply the payment or refund to close open debits or credits. You can specify the amount to apply. For example, you can apply partial payments to customer ledger entries. Closing customer ledger entries keeps customer statistics, account statements, finance charges, and so on, up-to-date.

 Tip

On the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, red font means that the related payment is past its due date. If overdue payments are becoming a problem, we can help you reduce their frequency. You can enable the **Late Payment Prediction Setup** extension, which uses a predictive model that we built in Azure Machine Learning to predict the timing of payments. These predictions help you reduce outstanding receivables and fine-tune your collections strategy. For example, if a payment is predicted to be late, you can adjust the terms of payment or the payment method for the customer. For more information, see [Late Payment Predictions](ui-extensions-late-payment-prediction).

You can apply customer ledger entries in several ways:

* Enter information on the following pages:
  + The **Payment Reconciliation Journals** page. For more information, see [Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts](receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts).
  + The **Payment Registration Setup** page. For more information, see [Reconcile Customer Payments from a List of Unpaid Sales Documents](receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents).
  + The **Cash Receipt Journals** page. For more information, see [To fill and post a cash receipt journal](#to-fill-and-post-a-cash-receipt-journal).
* By filling in the **Applies-to Doc. No.** field on sales credit memo documents. For more information, see [To apply a credit memo to a single customer ledger entry](#to-apply-a-credit-memo-to-a-single-customer-ledger-entry).
* By using the **Set Applies-to ID** action on a customer ledger entry. For more information, see [To apply a payment to a single customer ledger entry](#to-apply-a-payment-to-a-single-customer-ledger-entry).
* By using the **Apply Entries** action on the **Bank Deposit** page, and then entering the invoice number in the **Applies-to ID** field. For more information, see [Create Bank Deposits](bank-create-bank-deposits).

 Note

If the **Application Method** field on the customer card contains **Apply to Oldest**, payments are applied to the oldest open credit entry, unless you manually specify an entry. If the application method is **Manual**, you always apply entries manually.

To fill and post a cash receipt journal
---------------------------------------

A cash receipt journal is a type of general journal. You can use it to post transactions to general ledger, bank, customer, vendor, and fixed assets accounts. You can apply the payment to one or more debit entries when you post the payment. You can also apply from the posted entries later.

1. Choose the ![](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon, enter **Cash Receipt Journals**, and then choose the related link.
2. Choose the **Edit Journal** action.
3. Select the relevant batch in the **Batch Name** field.
4. Fill in the **Posting Date** field.
5. In the **Document Type** field, select **Payment**.
   
   The **Document No.** field is filled by the number series assigned to the batch.
6. Use the **External Document No.** field to store an identifier, such as the customer's check number.
   
    Note
   
   By default, the External Document No. field is hidden. If it is, and you want to use it, you can use personalization to add it. For more information, see [Personalize your workspace](ui-personalization-user).

8. Choose the **OK** button to post the application.
   
   If the posted application resulted in closed customer ledger entries, the **Open** field is cleared for these ledger entries.
9. To see the ledger entries, choose the ![](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link. Browse to the card for the relevant customer to see the ledger entries.

On the ledger entry list, on the line that contains the ledger entry that was fully applied to, you can see that the **Open** check box isn't selected.

 Note

After you select an entry on the **Apply Customer Entries** page, or several entries by setting the **Applies-to ID**, the **Applied Amount** field on the journal line will contain the sum of the remaining amounts for the posted entries you've selected, unless the field contains something already. If you select **Apply to Oldest** in the **Application Method** field on the customer card, the application occurs automatically.

To apply customer ledger entries in different currencies to one another
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency, you can still apply the invoice to the payment.

Here's an example. You apply Entry A in one currency to Entry B in another currency. The posting date on Entry A is used to find the exchange rate to use to convert amounts on Entry B. The exchange rate is found on the **Currency Exchange Rates** page.

Applying customer ledger entries in different currencies must be enabled. For more information, see [Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies](finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies).

1. Choose the ![](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon, enter **Cash Receipts Journal**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the journal you want, and fill in the first empty journal line using a currency code.
3. Choose the **Apply Entries** action.
4. Select the line with the entry you want to apply to the entry in the cash receipt journal, choose the **Set Applies-to ID** action, and then select the entry you want to apply to.
5. Choose the **OK** button to return to the cash receipt journal.
6. Post the sales journal.

 Important

When you apply entries in different currencies, the entries are converted to USD. Although the exchange rates for the two currencies are fixed, for example between USD and EUR, there may be a small residual amount when they are converted to USD. These small residual amounts are posted as gains and losses to the account specified in the **Realized Gains Account** or **Realized Losses Account** fields on the **Currencies** page. The **Amount (USD)** field is also adjusted on the vendor ledger entries.

To correct an application of customer entries
---------------------------------------------

When you correct an application, correcting entries are created and posted for all entries. The correcting entries are the same as the originals but have an opposite sign in the **Amount** field. The correcting entries include all general ledger entries derived from the application. For example, the payment discount and currency gains/losses. The entries that the application closed are reopened.

1. Choose the ![](media/ui-search/search_small.png) icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.
2. Open the relevant customer card.
3. Choose the **Ledger Entries** action.
4. Select the relevant ledger entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
5. Alternatively, choose the **Detailed Ledger Entry** action.
6. Select the application entry, and then choose the **Unapply Entries** action.
7. Fill in the fields in the header, and then choose the **Unapply** action.

 Important

If an entry has been applied by more than one application entry, you must unapply the latest application entry first.
