How Often to Clean a Hairbrush or Comb
--------------------------------------

"Cleaning your hairbrush regularly will get rid of dirt, product residue, and oils from the scalp that build up on the bristles over time," explains celebrity hairstylist Alex Brown.  


A thorough monthly cleaning is sufficient for most hairbrushes and combs. If you have very long hair or use lots of styling products, you may need to clean the tools every two weeks. It's a good idea to remove the tangled hair around the bristles regularly, even if you don't do a thorough cleaning. If you have [dandruff](https://www.realsimple.com/best-dandruff-shampoos-7568300), clean your hairbrush weekly to help prevent skin flakes from redepositing into your hair.

What You'll Need
----------------

### Equipment / Tools

* Pintail Comb
* Tweezers
* Toothbrush
* Sink or Bowl
* Towel
* Cotton Swab
### Materials

* Gentle Shampoo (Without Conditioners)
* Isopropyl Alcohol (Rubbing Alcohol)
* Disinfecting Spray
* Baking Soda

Instructions
------------

Do not use excessively hot water or heat when cleaning and drying a hairbrush. Synthetic bristles can become misshapen or melt, and high heat destroys the oils in natural bristles.

How to Clean Hairbrushes with Synthetic Bristles and Handles
------------------------------------------------------------

The steps for cleaning a hairbrush or comb depend on what type of brush you are cleaning. Brushes with synthetic (plastic) bristles and handles are the easiest to clean, while natural bristles or wooden-handled brushes require more careful attention. These steps work well with all types of synthetic bristles and handles, including cushioned and paddle brushes.

1. ### Remove the Hair
   
   Begin by removing as much hair as possible from the bristles. Use the end of a pintail comb, tweezers, or your fingers.
2. ### Wash the Brush
   
   Fill the bathroom sink or a large bowl with warm water. Add a generous squeeze (about two teaspoons) of shampoo and swish the brush in the solution to create some suds.
3. ### Let It Soak
   
   You can let the brush soak for 10 minutes or tackle the grime immediately. Use a clean toothbrush to scrub between the rows of bristles and around the handle.
4. ### Scrub With Baking Soda
   
   If there is an excess buildup of hair products, dip the damp toothbrush in some dry baking soda and continue scrubbing. The baking soda will act as a gentle abrasive to remove the gunk.
5. ### Rinse Thoroughly
   
   Rinse the brush well with warm water and shake out the excess water. Place it on a towel with the bristles down to dry.
6. ### Sanitize the Hairbrush
   
   Mix equal parts isopropyl alcohol and water. Dip the brush in the solution and place it on a towel, bristles facing down, to air dry.

How to Clean Natural-Bristle Hairbrushes
----------------------------------------

Natural-bristle hairbrushes are more expensive and promise to leave hair smoother and shinier than synthetic bristles. Boar bristles are generally considered the best quality and are usually mounted on a wooden handle.

1. ### Remove the Hair
   
   Begin by removing as much hair as possible from the bristles. Use the end of a pintail comb, tweezers, or your fingers.
2. ### Wash the Bristles
   
   In a shallow bowl that is wide enough to submerge the bristles but not the handle, mix warm water and about one teaspoon of gentle shampoo. Place the hairbrush over the bowl so that only the bristles are submerged. Allow the bristles to soak for 10 minutes. Remove the brush and use your hands to work the sudsy mixture between the rows of bristles, making sure you get down to the base.
   
   Wooden-handled hairbrushes should never be allowed to soak in water, as that can cause the brush to deteriorate and the bristles to loosen.
3. ### Clean the Wooden Brush Handle
   
   If the handle has excessive hair product buildup, dip a toothbrush in soapy water and lightly scrub to remove any residue. Wipe the handle with a clean towel and place it on a towel with the bristles down to air dry.
4. ### Rinse the Brush
   
   Quickly rinse the brush under warm running water. Then, place the brush bristles down on a towel to dry overnight.
5. ### Sanitize the Brush (Optional)
   
   If you feel the brush needs to be sanitized, lightly spray with a disinfecting spray like Lysol to kill bacteria. Do not use isopropyl alcohol, because it can dry out the natural bristles.

How to Clean a Synthetic Comb
-----------------------------

When you're cleaning your hairbrush, don't forget your combs. Synthetic combs—more commonly known as plastic combs—can also be composed of nylon or synthetic wax and are pretty easy to clean. Here's how.

1. ### Let the Comb Soak
   
   To clean combs made from synthetic materials, fill the sink with warm water and a squirt of shampoo. Add the combs and let them soak for at least 10 minutes.
2. ### Scrub Your Comb
   
   Use a toothbrush to scrub away any residue caught between the teeth. For tough stains or stuck-on debris, dip the toothbrush in some dry baking soda and scrub away.
3. ### Rinse Thoroughly
   
   Rinse the combs well in warm water. Then, place on a towel to air dry.
4. ### Sanitize Your Comb
   
   Dip a cloth or cotton swab in 70 percent isopropyl alcohol, then wipe the surface of the comb. Do not rinse; allow to air dry.

How to Clean a Wooden Comb
--------------------------

Wood doesn't react well to water, but that doesn't mean you should skip cleaning your wooden combs. Here's how.

1. ### Scrub Between the Teeth
   
   Dip a toothbrush in a warm, soapy water solution. Then, gently scrub between the teeth.
2. ### Wipe It Dry
   
   Wipe the comb with a clean towel. Then, allow it to air dry.
3. ### Sanitize If Needed
   
   To sanitize a wooden comb, spray lightly with a disinfecting spray. Then, allow it to dry before use.

If your brush needs a deep clean but the above steps don't work, soak your hairbrush in vinegar, as vinegar is a natural disinfectant that can get rid of stubborn dirt and grime better than shampoo and water. Grab a cup or shallow bowl of vinegar and let your hairbrush soak for up to 30 minutes. Follow the steps above and rinse the brush again. Then, air dry with the bristles down.

Tips for How to Keep a Hairbrush Clean Longer
---------------------------------------------

To keep your hairbrush and comb clean longer, there are some habits you can get into before and after every use.

* Remove the hair from the bristles after every use.
* Opt for less product in your hair to prevent buildup in the brush or use a different brush or method for combing when your [hair is dirty or oily](https://www.realsimple.com/beauty-fashion/hair/hair-care/how-often-should-you-wash-your-hair).
* If you want to clean your hairbrush and comb more frequently, consider investing in a cleaning spray specific to your type of brush.
* Store your brushes and combs in a closed space to prevent build-up of dust and debris.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

* What is the gray fuzz in my hairbrush?
  
  The gray fuzz you see is a mixture of dead skin cells, sebum, and old hair product—along with a little bit of dust, dirt, and lint, of course. If left alone, the gray matter can create bacteria, which can further contaminate your brush and your hair. When you start noticing this build-up, you should wash your brush or comb right away.
* Why are there so many hairs in my hairbrush?
  
  [People lose hair every day](https://www.realsimple.com/hair-thinning-vs-hair-loss-vs-hair-breakage-6824277)—a condition called telogen effluvium—and some of that will collect in your hairbrush as you're styling your hair. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, it's normal to lose up to 100 hairs per day, and inevitably, some of that will end up in your brush. With regular cleaning, though, it won't build up to become a big mess.12
* How often should you replace your hairbrush?
  
  When you [replace your hairbrush](https://www.realsimple.com/how-often-should-you-change-your-hairbrush-8652259) depends on both the type of brush you have and the quality. Drugstore-type hairbrushes made of plastic or rubber can probably last you six to 12 months, while natural boar bristle brushes can last about six months. If you spring for a high-quality brush like Oribe or Mason Pearson, it can last for a few years.
* What are the signs I need a new hairbrush?
  
  Missing or damaged bristles are a big giveaway that it's time to replace your hairbrush. And if the hairbrush still seems dirty after you've followed our cleaning steps, it may be time to bid your brush farewell.
