To help you manage accounts receivable, Business Central offers standard reports and analytics tools. You can also design various types of reports yourself, such as Power BI, Data Analysis, or Excel.

Analyze accounts receivable with Power BI
-----------------------------------------

The Power BI Finance app has multiple reports for accounts receivable.

Expand table

| To... | Open in Business Central (CTRL+select) | Learn more |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Analyze how many days it takes to collect accounts receivable. Find trends in the average collection period over time. Details such as the number of days, accounts receivable, and accounts receivable (average) provide context and enhance the analysis. | [Average Collection Period](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36992) | [About Average Collection Period](finance-powerbi-average-collection-period) |
| Categorize customer balances into aging buckets and see a breakdown by payment terms. Age by document date, due date, or posting date, and customize the aging bucket size by specifying the number of days. | [Aged Receivables (Back Dating)](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com?page=36993) | [About Aged Receivables (Back Dating)](finance-powerbi-aged-receivables-back-dating) |

To learn more, go to [Power BI finance app](finance-powerbi-app).

Analyze accounts receivable with Data Analysis
----------------------------------------------

You can use Data Analysis on the **Customer Ledger Entries** page to explore what your customers owe you. You can break down the information into time intervals for when amounts are due.

[![](media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries-ar-example.png)](media/data-analysis-customer-ledger-entries-ar-example.png#lightbox)

To learn more, go to [Using data analysis to analyze accounts receivable](ad-hoc-analysis-finance#example-finance-accounts-receivable).

Explore finance reports with Report Explorer
--------------------------------------------

To get an overview of the reports that are available for finance, choose **All Reports** on your Home page. This action opens the Role Explorer, which is filtered to the features in the **Report & Analysis** option. Under the **Finance** heading, choose **Explore**.

![](media/report-explorer-finance.png)

To learn more, go to [Finding pages and reports with the role explorer](ui-role-explorer).
