Distilled water is a purified form of water without minerals, and you can use it for so many things—from drinking, to watering plants, to filling humidifiers, to topping off fish tanks, and more. It’s also very easy to make at home with a few basic supplies. You actually have a few different methods to choose from depending on how much distilled [water](/Purify-Water) you’re trying to make. This wikiHow will walk you through all of them, step-by-step, so you can start making your very own distilled water right at home!

Things You Should Know
----------------------

* You’ll make distilled water by boiling water until it becomes vapor.
* Then, you’ll let the vapor condense back into liquid form, leaving you with pure water, free of minerals or contaminants.
* Distilled water is perfectly safe to drink, but because of the lack of minerals, it might taste flat in comparison to regular tap water.

The condensation will drip into the bowl. Allow the distillation process to continue until you have enough distilled water in the bowl for your needs.

However, drinking distilled water typically won’t result in mineral deficiencies, because most people will get enough minerals from their diet.[[1]](#_note-1)XResearch source
   * The biggest difference you’ll notice in drinking distilled water is the taste. The lack of minerals might make distilled water taste blander than tap water.
   * In some cases, it might be more beneficial to drink distilled water if the tap water is unsafe.

To make distilled water, first place a round baking rack in the bottom of a 5-gallon (19-L) stainless steel pot and fill the pot halfway with tap water. Then, place a glass bowl in the water so it floats. Turn the cover to the pot upside down, place it over the pot, and fill it with ice. Bring the water in the pot to a boil and let it boil for around 45 minutes. Replace the ice whenever it melts. The boiling water will turn to steam, rise up, and condense on the cold lid. When it condenses, it will drip back down into the bowl and fill it with distilled water. Once you have enough distilled water, turn off the heat and take off the lid. Use gloves to carefully remove the bowl full of water. Finally, let the distilled water cool before using it. To learn how to make distilled water from rainwater, scroll down!
