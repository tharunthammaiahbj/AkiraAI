INTRODUCTION:  
Bowers School is a historic school building located at 411 Water Street in Clinton, Massachusetts. Built in 1892, it was designed by architect Joshua Thissell and was dedicated in honor of Rev. Charles Manning Bowers. The school building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Today, it has been repurposed to house residences.

DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY:  
- Location: The Bowers School stands in a residential area on Clinton's east side, positioned between Schley and Branch Streets, along Water Street, a major east-west road.  
- Structure: The building is a two-story brick structure, featuring a granite foundation and a combination of gables and hips in its roof design. It is rectangular, with a projecting entry pavilion on the north-facing facade, and the entrance is recessed in a rectangular opening, surrounded by round-arched windows.  
- Interior: Originally, the interior was divided into two classrooms on each floor, with stairs in the projecting pavilion and maintenance facilities in the basement.  
- Historical Background: The first school on this site was a small wood-frame structure built in 1847. Clinton's rapid growth necessitated a larger school, leading to the construction of the Bowers School.  
- Architect: Designed by Joshua Thissell, a local architect and civil engineer, this building became a model for other school constructions in the area.  
- Current Use: After its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, the building was vacant, but it now houses residential properties.
