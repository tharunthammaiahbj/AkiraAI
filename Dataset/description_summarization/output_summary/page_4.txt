ABSTRACT: Alan Hinkes OBE is an English Himalayan high-altitude mountaineer. He is the first British mountaineer to claim all 14 Himalayan eight-thousanders.

BODY:

INTRODUCTION:
Alan Hinkes OBE (born 26 April 1954) is an English Himalayan high-altitude mountaineer from Northallerton in North Yorkshire. He is the first British mountaineer to claim all 14 Himalayan eight-thousanders (mountains above 8,000 m (26,247 ft) in height), a feat he completed on 30 May 2005.

14 EIGHT-THOUSANDERS:

BRITISH RECORD:
Hinkes is the first British mountaineer to claim to have summited all 14 mountains with elevations above 8,000 metres (26,247 ft), known as the eight-thousanders, when he summited Kangchenjunga on 30 May 2005.
It was first achieved by Reinhold Messner in 1986 (all without oxygen), and two decades later, Hinkes was only the 13th person to claim the feat, days after U.S. climber Ed Viesturs became the 12th person on 22 May 2005.
It is a rare feat, as the ratio of deaths to summits on several eight-thousanders is at one-in-five (Annapurna, K2, Nanga Parbat, Kangchenjunga).
Hinkes took 26 attempts to climb the 14 eight-thousanders (not counting his ascent of Shishapangma Central (West) in 1990), giving a first attempt success rate of circa 54%. Hinkes spent 21 years on his "Challenge 8000", starting with his ascent of Shishapangma in 1987, and ending with his ascent of Kangchenjunga in 2005. Hinkes is recorded as summiting Mount Everest on 19 May 1996.

OBSERVATIONS:
He regards K2 as the hardest eight-thousander mountain ("an easy place to die"), which he climbed on his third attempt. He ranks Kanchenjunga as the second hardest eight-thousander mountain, which he also climbed on his third attempt.
As an eight-thousander climber, Hinkes has encountered death on his own expeditions, and on neighbouring expeditions. Several of his climbing partners subsequently died on mountains.
Hinkes had to be air rescued from Nanga Parbat in July 1997.
Hinkes has climbed eight-thousanders in many styles: expeditions, two-man alpine, and alone.
He describes himself as risk-averse.
Over the years, Hinkes has had public arguments with other chasers of the 14 eight-thousanders.

CHO OYU DISPUTE:
His 30 April 1990 ascent of Cho Oyu, which he completed alone in low visibility, is disputed by one observer.
Cho Oyu has a broadly flat summit plateau with no cairn. The summit is a small unmarked "hump".
The source of the dispute was that Himalayan chronicler Elizabeth Hawley "unrecognised" his Cho Oyu ascent in Spring 2005. Hawley agrees Hinkes reached the summit plateau but questions how Hinkes could have been on the “technical” summit for certain, if he could not see it.
Hinkes logged the expedition's 30 April 1990 Cho Oyu ascent in the 1991 American Alpine Journal.
Czech team member Josef Rakoncaj photographed Hinkes on the summit plateau of Cho Oyu.
Climbers with several Cho Oyu ascents, have disputed Hawley's main Cho Oyu summit criteria, "Did you see Everest?"
The dispute is noted in many Hinkes interviews. He highlights the lack of any evidence, or publicly verifiable sources, for the allegation.

PERSONAL:
In January 2006, after Kangchenjunga, Hinkes was awarded an OBE in the 2006 New Year Honours List for his achievements in mountaineering.
He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the University of Sunderland in 1999, and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of York in 2007. He was awarded Yorkshire Man of the Year in 2005, and was made an honorary citizen of his hometown Northallerton in the same year.
Hinkes is an avid photographer and released a photographic essay book in October 2013 called *8000 Metres Climbing the World's Highest Mountains*. He is the subject of an October 2017 documentary by filmmaker, Terry Abraham, *Alan Hinkes: The First Briton To Climb The World's Highest Mountains*.
Hinkes started life as a geography and PE teacher. He never married but has a daughter, Fiona.
