INTRODUCTION:
Corvus Robotics, founded by Mohammed Kabir ’21, uses autonomous drones to improve inventory management in warehouses, particularly in GPS-denied environments. These drones can work continuously, scanning barcodes and tracking products, thus solving the problem of lost inventory and improving operational efficiency.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:

Autonomous drones can operate in warehouses 24/7, even in low-light conditions.
AI-driven technology enables drones to scan barcodes and precisely track products.
Corvus One drone is designed for indoor aerial navigation, offering infrastructure-free autonomy.
Successfully improved inventory management for distributors, logistics providers, and manufacturers.
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION:

Neural networks and camera-based navigation are used for operations in GPS-denied environments.
Corvus One drone uses 14 cameras for navigation and barcode scanning, providing seamless integration with warehouse management systems.
The drone’s system can automatically categorize discrepancies and suggest resolutions.
FOUNDER BACKGROUND:

Mohammed Kabir, a long-time drone enthusiast, started working on drones at age 14. He co-founded Corvus Robotics with Jackie Wu, leveraging their expertise in drone technology and AI.
APPLICATION AND IMPACT:

Corvus drones provide a faster, more accurate alternative to traditional inventory management methods, eliminating the need for forklifts and manual data entry.
Warehouse workers can use drones alongside forklifts without disruption, improving safety and operational speed.
The technology is already in use by companies like MSI, a nationwide building materials distributor.
BUSINESS GROWTH:

After successful pilots, Corvus expanded its customer base, with MSI using Corvus drones daily across multiple facilities.
VISION FOR THE FUTURE:

The company aims to extend its technology to cover the full lifecycle of inventory management, including the tracking of products before they reach warehouse racks.
Corvus plans to provide a comprehensive solution that addresses inefficiencies in both product arrival and rack storage processes.
CONCLUSION:
Corvus Robotics is pioneering the use of drones for efficient and autonomous inventory management, offering unprecedented precision and operational efficiency for warehouses. The company's vision includes revolutionizing the entire inventory lifecycle, from product receipt to storage.
