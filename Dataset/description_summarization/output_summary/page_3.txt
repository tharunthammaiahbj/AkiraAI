AUTHOR: By Duncan MacRae, December 23, 2024

INTRODUCTION:
Ordnance Survey (OS), Great Britain’s national mapping agency, is leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to transform the geospatial technology landscape. Manish Jethwa, OS’s CTO, outlines key developments and challenges shaping the sector.

Key Highlights
AI Integration and Accessibility
Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs):
LLMs paired with sophisticated agents simplify natural language interaction with geospatial datasets, making them mainstream and user-friendly. This helps bridge the gap between complex geospatial data and the general public.

Specific Task Training:
OS is training models to automate complex tasks, such as feature extraction from imagery. This reduces manual intervention and improves the accuracy of geospatial data processing, while also ensuring the use of validation tools to enhance the data’s usability.

Ethical Considerations
Responsible AI Charter:
OS places great emphasis on developing AI systems that are transparent, fair, and unbiased, considering both societal and environmental impacts. This is an essential part of their responsible AI strategy, ensuring that technology benefits all stakeholders.

Workforce Development:
OS recognizes the importance of retraining and upskilling employees, ensuring that human creativity, emotional intelligence, and other essential traits remain in the workplace, despite digital transformations. This helps companies maintain a balance between innovation and human-centered values.

Challenges in Adoption
Cultural Resistance and Change Fatigue:
Resistance to rapid technological changes can hinder progress. Organizations need to find ways to address this cultural resistance and manage change fatigue effectively, ensuring smoother adoption of AI technologies.

Cybersecurity Threats:
As AI-driven threats become more sophisticated, OS highlights the need for robust cybersecurity strategies. Protecting data from malicious AI-powered attacks requires companies to rethink their cybersecurity strategies and ensure comprehensive safeguards are in place.

Vision for Progress
Adapting to Evolving Customer Expectations:
To stay competitive, companies must adapt to changing customer needs and expectations, ensuring that they remain relevant in the digital age.

Talent Retention and Communication:
Effective communication of goals, milestones, and progress is key to sustaining momentum in digital transformation. Furthermore, attracting and retaining top talent is crucial for organizations to maintain a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.

CONCLUSION:
AI’s advancements in geospatial technology have immense potential for 2025, but companies must navigate challenges carefully. Balancing innovation with ethical considerations, managing risks, and maintaining a human-centered approach will ensure sustainable growth in the geospatial sector.
