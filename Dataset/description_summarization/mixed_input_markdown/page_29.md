Summary

**India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score:** Yashasvi Jaiswal has dropped anchor and batted completely against his usual aggressive self. He survived the first hour with opening partner Rohit Sharma but saw the latter and KL Rahul fall to Pat Cummins in the same over shortly thereafter. Earlier, Jasprit Bumrah took just four balls to finish off the Australian innings on Day 5. India now have a record target of 340 to chase. The Boxing Day Test has reached its final day and all three results are still in play at the MCG.

**India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score:** Yashasvi Jaiswal dropped anchor in the first session led the Indian resistance. He has been more aggressive in the second though with Rishabh Pant and is inching towards a gritty half-century, his second of the match. Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul earlier fell in the same over to Pat Cummins shortly after the drinks break in the first session of Day 5 of the 4th Test between India and Australia at the MCG. Rohit and Jaiswal dealt with some utterly unplayable deliveries from Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and later Scott Boland but the Indian openers were a picture of concentration as they survived the early pace salvo. Rohit in particular looked far better than ever on this tour but fell for just nine runs off nine off 40 balls. India are chasing a target of 340, much higher than the record for the highest succesfull Test run chase at the MCG which was set all the way back in 1928....Read More

It was Jasprit Bumrah once again for India. Mohammed Siraj bowled the first over of Day 5 and then Bumrah took just four balls to uproot Nathan Lyon's middle stump and end his extraordinary last wicket stand with Scott Boland. Australia were all out for 234 in their second innings and India now have to chase a target of 340, well over the previous record for highest succesfull run chase at the MCG, to take back the series lead.

If India’s fans, team, and management were asked at the beginning of day four whether they would have accepted Australia being at 228-9 at close of play, everyone would likely have bitten your hand off after the hole the team had found itself in earlier in the Boxing Day Test match. But following the ups-and-downs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, a day which saw Australia be 80-2, then 91-6, then 148-6, and then 173-9, there is a certain air of deflation regarding how the day ended for India. For many, this will be seen as an opportunity lost, a chance to complete a remarkable come-from-behind win gone begging, a golden opportunity to take a 2-1 series lead against all the odds.

Nitish Kumar Reddy’s fine century came to an end early in the day as he attempted to hit out, and Australia were back in to bat with the goal of putting up runs through the day and letting the decision for a declaration be in their own hands. It all seemed to be going okay with Marnus Labuschagne and Steven Smith at the crease, but a Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah inspired flurry of wickets saw the middle order blown open, four wickets falling for just 11 runs.

Bumrah dismissed Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh, and Alex Carey in quick succession, also passing the 200 Test wickets mark on the way and keeping his average under 20. Another feather in the cap of a remarkable career so far for India’s gun bowler. India were truly in the ascendancy at that point, with this rapid wave of wickets making it seem as if Australia might fold very quickly, with the lead only just at 200, setting the stage for a relatively comfortable Indian chase.

The Australian resistance began with a solid 57-run partnership with Marnus Labuschagne and Pat Cummins, who steadied the ship after the chaos of the previous few overs. While Labuschagne slightly rode his luck, he was still his solid and compact self, while Cummins continued to show why he is Australia’s man for every crisis, whether with bat or with ball. The partnership ensured Australia put more runs on the board and also softened the ball as it got older.

Cummins also played the role of the aggressor, looking for boundaries whenever possible. While the pitch was slightly trickier than earlier in the match, there were by no means any demons that would concern the batters too much. Labuschagne was dismissed soon after, but Cummins added on some more crucial runs. Nevertheless, Australia found themselves at 173-9, a solid lead of 278 runs, which would still have allowed India to be confident in the chase on day five.

Suddenly, however, Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland gave a terrific account of themselves as numbers 10 and 11, looking surprisingly comfortable against the bowling as they not only survived, but also started ticking over the runs. A couple of boundaries and plenty of strike rotation allowed the score to keep ballooning, and before India knew what had struck them, Lyon suddenly turned on the motor towards the end of day’s play to heap on 28 runs off the last 5 overs. Lyon ended play on 41\*, off just 54 deliveries, scoring at a strike rate of nearly 80 as Australia crossed 200 and the lead suddenly became 333.

India will be desperate to get rid of Lyon or Boland, with Australia undoubtedly also considering an early if not overnight declaration with 333 just on the cusp of too many runs for a team to score in one day’s play. India will be very annoyed by the bonus runs they allowed Australia’s last pair to add, with the duo adding on a half-century stand when nobody expected them to.

A lot of pressure will be on Yashasvi Jaiswal, who dropped a fairly standard catch off Labuschagne and allowed potentially 30-40 extra runs on the total. India will likely look to be optimistic and positive while entering the field, with eyes on pulling off something similar to the Gabba victory from the last tour with an against-the-odds chase in the fourth innings. India will know they have players capable of scoring, but will also be careful with not losing wickets, on a pitch where 10 wickets fell on day four and will only get trickier as play progresses.

Expect India to be circumspect in the first 30-40 overs through to the middle of the afternoon session, where the state of the game will determine whether the likes of Nitish Kumar Reddy and Rishabh Pant will go all-out in order to try and seal a win or whether they will look to preserve their wickets and see out a draw.

This Test will reach its final days with all three results possible, the way everyone would have wanted such a high-profile match to go. An early start, but an unmissable one, coming up at the MCG.

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Pant gets a four!
---------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Right, his strike rate has gone above 30 with that. Pant blocks the first ball of Starc's second over of the spell back to the bowler. Then Starc bowls a yorker on Pant's legs but the latter has never been troubled by those in his Test career, tucks it away fine for a four. Starc induces a thick edge off the fifth ball that runs to deep third man and Pant takes a single. Jaiswal defends the last ball back to the bowler. He is on 63 off 159, Pant on 28 off 87.

India 112/3 in 53 overs

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Wow the Australians really have some injury worries to grapple with going into the final Test. Josh Hazlewood is out for the series, now Starc returns to bowl his 13th over and he clutches his back after sending in the first to Jaiswal. 50 overs have been done and India have scored 104 runs. We are seeing cricket from a different era here folks, soak it in. The T20 stuff is around the corner, and so savour the real stuff while you have it.

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Pant deals with some hostility from Cummins
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Pant has done a Pujara here, which is quite hard to believe. Cummins shortens his length and gives Pant some of the short stuff that he gave Reddy yesterday. He sends an awkward one for Pant third ball, he ends up taking it on the bicep. He blocks the next two balls down and then ducks for the last. Pant has scored just 18 off 69, a strike rate of less than 25. Jaiswal at the other end on 58 off 141 balls.

India 97/3 in 47 overs

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Yashasvi Jaiswal survives three bad shots
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Sunil Gavaskar did NOT enjoy that in the commentary box. Jaiswal takes almighty swings at the fourth and fifth balls of Lyon's sixth over, mishits both of them and somehow, they don't go for a catch or chop on to the stumps. And yet, he goes for a big expansive drive last ball of the over, exactly what Lyon was inviting, beaten on outside edge.

India 95/3 in 44 overs

Dec 30, 2024 8:58 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: India now need 250 to win

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Well this is quite a partnership. Jaiswal has scored 54 in 131 balls, Pant on 17 off 49 balls. 42 overs have been bowled so far and about 52 are left for the day. This is Test cricket and this excellent pitch is not as flat as the one that was there at the Gabba a few years ago for THAT Test. But hey, you never know. Cummins continues for the 43rd over, his 13th. Just one run off it for Jaiswal.

India 93/3 in 43 overs

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: ABSOLUTE CARNAGE AT THE MCG!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Ok this has to be the most aggressive way that a team can play for a draw. Rishabh Pant asks Yashasvi Jaiswal to calm down after the latter ran halfway down the pitch without the former being interested first ball of the 34th by Boland. Then they run a tight single, run another off the overthrow that comes as a result and then run a third off a second overthrow! How about it! Jaiswal runs a single next ball and that is also a no ball. That is all the runs that come from this over.

India's deficit has suddenly come down to 275 runs needed. If these two keep going like this, you just never know.

India 65/3 in 34 overs

Dec 30, 2024 8:12 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: It's a record crowd at the MCG
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Wow what a sight this is. A capacity crowd on Day 5 despite it being a weekday. This is as much a tribute to the level of cricket that has been played by these two teams in this Test as anything else.

Dec 30, 2024 8:04 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Jaiswal saved by umpire's call!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Jaiswal must be thanking his lucky stars here. He is getting the kind of luck that Virat Kohli hasn't got for five years now. Starc also stays short, but not really as wide as Boland. Jaiswal plays the fourth ball of the 31st through gully for four. Then the fifth hammers into the pads and the Aussies appeal with gusto. Joel Wilson shakes his head and Cummins takes the review at the last second. No bat of course and it is umpire's call with almost half the ball projected to hit the leg stump! Starc walks back to the start of his run up fuming, a lot of the Aussies are fuming in fact. Jaiswal survives to fight another day. He is on 31 off 98 at the end of the over, Pant on four off 14.

India 54/3 in 31 overs

Dec 30, 2024 7:57 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Two more fours for Jaiswal and Pant now
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Well this is probably less of India changing tactics and more of Boland not really reading the room bowling-wise. Carey is standing up to the stumps and still Boland is bowling it short and wide. The second ball of the 30th over is sent to the boundary by Jaiswal with a powerful square cut. He takes a single next ball and then Pant smashes another short and wide ball to the boundary offside. Pant on four off 14, Jaiswal on 27 off 92.

India 50/3 in 30 overs

Dec 30, 2024 7:52 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: BACK TO BACK FOURS! Jaiswal frees his arms a little
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Jaiswal showing that he is not in a shell here. Gets a hint of width from Boland fourth ball, Jaiswal leans back and crashes a square cut past point for the first boundary after 22 overs. Then he goes up and over gully for another four. His strike rate goes into the 20s, he is on 22 off 89 balls at the end of that over. Alex Carey has come up to the stumps again, as he has done a lot of times today to the pacers, but Jaiswal very happy staying in his crease with this length.

India 41/3 in 28 overs

Dec 30, 2024 7:44 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: A wicket-maiden from Starc
------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Pant defends the first ball he faces, misses the flick second ball, defends next two and then is beaten off the last. Now Boland comes in from the other end to the Pujara-esque Yashasvi Jaiswal. Wonder what will happen if Pant gets on strike this over…

India 33/3 in 27 overs

Dec 30, 2024 7:39 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Out come Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rishabh Pant
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Well, Gavaskar spoke about Pant and now here he is, walking out with Yashasvi Jaiswal. Pant will take strike of course and Starc has the ball in his hands, ready to bowl the rest of the 27th over.

Dec 30, 2024 7:34 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Sunil Gavaskar on his 'stupid' comment for Rishabh Pant
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Sunil Gavaskar probably reflected the emotions of practically all Indian fans and most neutral cricket fans with his passionate reaction to Rishabh Pant's dismissal yesterday. He has spoken more about with a great deal of humility now.

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: LUNCH! India 33/3 in 26.1 overs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: India would be unhappy with that and Virat Kohli in particular has to do some real introspection going into the England tour later in 2025, if not before the next Test. He has been incredibly watchful in both innings of this Test and yet, it is now a proven fact that he is a walking wicket if you keep inviting him to drive. India needed him to stay in the middle, now they are three down at Lunch despite their openers seeing through the first hour.

THAT SAID… One cannot possibly ignore the fact that the Australians have been just relentless. In fact it is quite a wonder how India have managed to seemingly match Australia step for step despite this huge disparity in the quality of the attacks. Starc, Cummins and Boland, the former two in particular, have been unrelenting in their lines and lengths. One may say that the Indians need to play like Yashasvi Jaiswal but even he has had oodles of luck to go with his remarkable patience and skill. We are seeing the absolute best the sport of cricket has to offer here and we potentially have 70 more overs of it today. Strap in! But after getting some breakfast in if you are in India in this Lunch break of course.

Dec 30, 2024 6:59 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: OUT! STARC GETS KOHLI!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Edged and gone! That fatal drive outside off has done Kohli again. Starc sends the first ball of the 27th full and away from the off stump, inviting Kohli to drive. Like a fish that just cannot help but go for the bait, Kohli takes a waft at it and perishes.

Virat Kohli c Khawaja b Starc 5 (29)

India 33/2 in 26 overs

Dec 30, 2024 6:57 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Nathan Lyon is in
---------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Well we are counting down to Lunch and so it will be interesting to see if Lyon can getting anything out of this pitch. Kohli has been hit on the thumb on his bottom hand by Marsh early in his innings but he doesn't seem to be feeling any effect of that. He is on four off 27 having just seen off a few jaffas from Starc in the 25th, Jaiswal remains on 13 off 78 and he is facing Lyon now.

India 31/2 in 25 overs

Dec 30, 2024 6:47 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Starc returns, more discipline from Jaiswal
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: There may have been some eyebrows raised when Marsh came to bowl over Starc's fitness but here he is. His battle with Jaiswal resumes, the batter tucks the first ball to midwicket and the second is left. Jaiswal defends the third and leaves the next two balls. Short one last ball, Jaiswal rides the bounce and defends down. Jaiswal is on 13 off 78. He has a career strike rate of nearly 70 but he is going at a shade over 16.50 today. Incredible from the young opener. Marsh to continue from the other end for the 24th over, Kohli batting on four off 15.

India 30/2 in 23 overs

Dec 30, 2024 6:40 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Kohli is off the mark
-------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Every run that these Indian batters are getting is being cheered now. Make no mistake, India now have a monumental task ahead of them and a lot will depend on how Kohli and Jaiswal do here. They need to chase down 312 more runs and so it is safe to assume that the win is highly unlikely now. They need to somehow survive a majority of the remaining 70-odd overs. For now, Jaiswal has batted 72 balls for 13 runs, Kohli has two in nine.

India 28/2 in 21 overs

Dec 30, 2024 6:32 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Mitch Marsh into the attack
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Well Marsh is into the attack earlier than usual replacing Scott Boland. Jaiswal is on strike and Carey is standing up to the stumps. He has made 12 runs in 63 balls, Virat Kohli yet to get off the mark in six balls.

India 25/2 in 19 overs

Dec 30, 2024 6:18 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: GONE! KL RAHUL GONE FOR A DUCK, CUMMINS ON FIRE!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Oh a quick one-two and the Australian captain has given his exactly what they were looking for. KL Rahul, India's best batter on this tour, has fallen for a duck. Cummins bangs the last ball into the corridor, extra bounce and Rahul plays an uncertain push. Edged straight to first slip. Very uncharacteristic from Rahul, who has left the ball so well in this series. Incredible stuff from Pat Cummins.

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: OUT! Sharp catch by Marsh and Cummins gets Rohit again
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: A breakthrough at last for Australia. That is probably Rohit's first truly aggressive shot off side, he did go for a pull in Cummins's previous over that didn't work. Cummins fires the first ball of the 17th over full and Rohit goes for a square drive. Thick outside edge and the ball absolutely bullets to gully where Marsh takes the catch at his shoulder. Rohit has looked better than ever on this tour today but he goes with just nine runs on board.

Rohit c Marsh b Cummins 9 (40)

India 25/1 in 16.1 overs

Dec 30, 2024 6:06 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Drinks in the first session! India 22/0 in 15 overs, need 318 to win
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Jaiswal on 10 off 53, Rohit on eight off 37. As stated earlier, it becomes a different game as the ball gets to around 25 overs old and that is just about 10 overs away. This has been a very good grind from Jaiswal and Rohit. Australia need 10 wickets and they would've targetted getting at least a wicket before drinks break in the first session. So that is one tick for India.

Dec 30, 2024 6:03 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Rohit and Jaiswal continue to battle
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: 14 overs have gone and you get the feeling that Australia are getting slightly itchy for a wicket. Rohit and Jaiswal may not have scored too many but Australia would know just how difficult it would be to get 10 wickets if they can't get any scalps in the first 20 overs. It becomes a batting paradise after around 25 to 30 overs. Jaiswal is on 10 off 49, Rohit on seven off 35, Cummins has brought himself back in the attack and he continues in the 15th over.

India 21/0 in 14 overs

Dec 30, 2024 5:44 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Rohit and Jaiswal survive 10 almost unplayable overs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 Live Score: Nothing less than pure excellence from Starc, Cummins and now Boland. Jaiswal and Rohit have had to use every ounce of their concentration and skill and even then, they've needed oodles of luck to still be out there. Jaiswal has reached eight runs in 34 balls, Rohit on five off 26.

In case you are wondering, India need 323 to win off around 82 overs

India 17/0 in 10 overs

Dec 30, 2024 5:36 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Scott Boland takes the ball
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: All right Pat Cummins takes himself off the attack, home favourite Scott Boland is in for the eighth over. Most of the noise today has been for whatever good things India have done, big support for the visitors today. But a big cheer goes around the ground as Boland revs up.

India 12/0 in 7 overs

Dec 30, 2024 5:30 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Rohit is off the mark!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Regardless of which way this innings goes, we are seeing a very different Rohit Sharma here. He has taken to blasting the ball everywhere in the last one and a half years regardless of the format but today, he has been a picture of concentration, trusting his defence and leaving the ball dilligently. Cummins angles the third ball of the sixth on off stump, Rohit pushes it to cover and gets his first run of the innings. Jaiswal then takes a single off the fifth as well. He is on seven off 21, Rohit on 1 off 15.

India 8/0 in 6 overs

Dec 30, 2024 5:27 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: FOUR! Jaiswal with a beauty off Starc
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Well it isn't quite the previous over but it is still the kind of stuff that can bring a batter down to his knees from Starc. Jaiswal, though, is made of tougher stuff than most mere mortals. He defends the first two balls, leaves the third and fourth. For some reason Australia appeal for the latter despite the ball being about 3 feet away from any part of Jaiswal's body or bat. Jaiswal sways out of the line of the fifth and then he gets one that is full and straight. Jaiswal latches on to it with a wonderful straight drive past the bowler for a four. He moves to six off 19, Rohit at the other end a picture of concentration against Cummins on nought off 11.

India 6/0 in 5 overs

Dec 30, 2024 5:20 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Unplayable stuff from Starc!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Just how do you deal with that? Well Jaiswal probably showed the one way you can play an over like that which is see the ball fizz past your outside edge and then breath a sigh of relief. He is beaten on the second, fifth and sixth balls, all of them pitching full just outside off, forcing the batter to play and leaving him late. Jaiswal also leaves a ball that darts in and goes just over his middle stump fourth delivery. Batting in Test cricket is not for the faint hearted. Jaiswal on 2 off 13, Rohit yet to get off the mark after facing five balls.

India 2/0 in 3 overs

Dec 30, 2024 5:09 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: CLOSE CALL FOR ROHIT!
-------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Oh for the millionth time in this Test match, an edge doesn't carry. Back of a length from Cummins to end the second over, Rohit pushes at it but the ball nips away late. It is edged to second slip, but reaches Smith after a bounce.

India 2/0 in 2 overs

Dec 30, 2024 5:02 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: One run in the first over, Rohit survives...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Jaiswal leaves the first two balls, then plays at the third but it is a peach from Starc. Late movement away and Jaiswal is beaten. Jaiswal gets thick inside edge to square leg on a drive fourth ball, then he tucks away a yorker to square leg for a single. Rohit then defends the last ball to gully.

Dec 30, 2024 4:58 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal walk out
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Right not too much time wasted in the turnaround. This incredible Test goes into its final leg. It will be interesting to see how these Indian openers approach this and how long Rohit Sharma can last considering the horrid run of form he has been in. Jaiswal is on strike though, and Mitchell Starc is steaming in. India may have to face a maximum of just over 90 overs today.

Dec 30, 2024 4:48 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: BOWLED HIM! Bumrah uproots the middle stump, India need 340 to win
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Bumrah stands and stares at Lyon for a few seconds before turning away after cleaning up the latter's middle stumps. The great man has another fifer. India have a target of 340 to chase, if they decide to give it a go. Well we will say a lot about India's batting for the rest of the day but let's take a moment for Jasprit Bumrah. This is the last we see of him in this Test and, as great as this match has been, it will be the poorer for it. This was full and straight, induces Lyon to drive but it nips back just that bit to take the spinner's middle stump.

Dec 30, 2024 4:45 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: 5 runs in the first over of the day
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: The second ball was edged off Boland through the slip cordon for a four. Then a leg bye off the last ball. And so the last-wicket stand carries on but here comes Jasprit Bumrah, which really makes the innings a different Test match every time.

Australia 233/9, lead by 338 runs

Dec 30, 2024 4:41 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Australia have not declared!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Well this is quite unusual. Australia have decided to let India dismiss them, no declaration. And so Scott Boland is on strike to Mohammed Siraj. He is on 10 off 65 balls, Nathan Lyon on 41 off 54 balls.

Australia 228/9, lead India by 333 runs

Dec 30, 2024 4:39 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Pitch report on Day 5!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Sunil Gavaskar says that it is now a very good pitch for batting. “Pitch looks very very good still. This is a pitch that has been rolled out nicely, grass is gone, no devils on the pitch at all. India shouldn't have much problems if they apply themselves,” he said on Star Sports.

Dec 30, 2024 4:35 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Bumrah's big celebration for Konstas
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: That was perhaps the greatest praise Konstas could've got on debut. He had left India a ragged bunch and was cajoling the crowd throughout their innings. Bumrah doesn't usually celebrate his wickets enthusiastically and the fact that an all-time great was thrilled to get you out should be a huge boost for a 19-year-old.

Dec 30, 2024 4:23 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: The stage is set…
---------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: The MCG is a picture today. One of the two teams who will play in the WTC Final this year was decided by an absolute thriller of a Test match yesterday. Considering how the Border-Gavaskar Trophy has gone, be very surprised if you are not surprised by what happens today.

Dec 30, 2024 4:20 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Jasprit Bumrah doing the heavy lifting
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Bumrah has been in the kind of form that puts him in the same bracket as some of the all-time greats. Conversely, the rest of the Indian bowlers have been woefully short of form, with yesterday probably being the best day Mohammed Siraj has had. Bumrah has bowled 52 overs in match so far. Meanwhile, India's 5th and 6th bowlers have combined bowled 27 overs in this match and have picked only 1 wicket for 81 runs.

Dec 30, 2024 4:11 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: An early start today...
---------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: There was some time l on Day 3 due to rain which has led to Days 4 and 5 starting early. Today's play is scheduled to start at a very cricket time of 10.09am local time, which converts to 4.39am IST. Every minute counts.

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Marnus Labuschagne said in an interview after the day's play yesterday that Australia wanted to get a few overs at the end of Day 4 but were not happy with the amount of runs they had.

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Virat Kohli 'back as captain' on Day 4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: When India returned to bowl for Australia's second innings after Nitish Kumar Reddy's epic knock yesterday morning, they made the MCG as hostile as it can be for a home batter. And leading that chorus was, no prizs for guessing, Virat Kohli. However, Kohli wasn't just chirping away. He was directing fielders and constantly in the ear of the bowler, unless it was Jasprit Bumrah of course. All of it seemed to be done with the blessing of Rohit Sharma, as he could be seen walking up to chat with the captain after almost every delivery. And well, why not. Kohli is arguably among the greatest Test captains India, or any team, has ever had. Regardless of what his batting form is, he just seems to get Test cricket in ways that few in the world do today.

Dec 30, 2024 3:43 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Last time a target of over 300 was chased down at the MCG…
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: The last time a team chased down a target over 300 in a Test at MCG was before the Second World War. A look at the scorecard from that match played from December 29 to January 5 in 1929 shows that it may have been quite an epic, with England's second innings lasting a whopping 159.5 overs. The names on the two scorecards include some that now exist in cricket's folklore - Don Bradman, Wally Hammond, Douglas Jardine, Herbert Sutcliffe, Percy Chapman, Jack Ryder, and Harold Larwood, to name a few.

Dec 30, 2024 3:30 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: A record chase coming up if India go for it...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs. Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Test cricket has been played for more than a century at the MCG, and in all this time, no team has successfully chased a target as high as Australia's current lead. The highest succesfull chase of all time came in 1928 when England chased down a target of 332 with three wickets to spare.

Dec 30, 2024 3:14 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Bumrah's reminder that he is human
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Something very rare happened yesterday. Rohit Sharma asked Jasprit Bumrah to take the old ball and end the pesky stand between Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland but the spearhead told him that he has nothing left in the tank. He was only talking about the old ball, of course, for Bumrah took the new cherry as soon as it became available for him and almost took the last wicket as well, only for it to be called a no ball as he had overstepped. He has been bowling like a god but late yesterday came a reminder that Jasprit Bumrah is human after all.

Dec 30, 2024 3:09 AM IST

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Yashasvi Jaiswal has a nightmare
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Yashasvi Jaiswal is a reliable catcher in the cordon behind the stumps. This has been an established fact in his short career. Anybody who saw him for the first time yesterday, however, wouldn't believe you if even you said this to them while swearing on your nearest loved ones. And Rohit Sharma couldn't help but show his emotions at the second drop.

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: Jasprit Bumrah - 'nuff said
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

India vs Australia 4th Test Day 5 LIVE Score: This name is being increasingly associated with perfection. A win for India has been improbable ever since the morning of the third day when Steve Smith went about plundering them for runs. And yet, for about half an hour yesterday, that looked like a real possibility. That was because Bumrah sent back Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh in one over and Alex Carey in the next. Australia suddenly found themselves down to their last four wickets with less than 200 on board. During that wicket burst, Bumrah became the first player to get to 200 Test wickets at a career average of less than 20. That's right. Think of Malcolm Marshall, Joel Garner, Dennis Lillee, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, Muttiah Muralitharan, Shane Warne, Anil Kumble, Ravichandran Ashwin; none of them averaged as low as Bumrah when they got to this mark.
