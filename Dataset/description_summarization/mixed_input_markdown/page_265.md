[Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
-------------------------------

* **Access to GitHub Copilot**. See [What is GitHub Copilot?](/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot#getting-access-to-copilot).
* **Latest version of Visual Studio Code**. See the [Visual Studio Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
* **The GitHub Copilot extension** - Install this from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot). For more information, see "[Set up GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup)" in the Microsoft documentation.
* **Sign in to GitHub in Visual Studio Code**. If you experience authentication issues, see "[Troubleshooting issues with GitHub Copilot Chat in IDEs](/en/copilot/troubleshooting-github-copilot/troubleshooting-issues-with-github-copilot-chat-in-ides#troubleshooting-authentication-issues-in-your-editor)."

If you have access to GitHub Copilot via your organization, you won't be able to use GitHub Copilot Chat if your organization owner has disabled chat. See "[Managing policies for Copilot in your organization](/en/copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-and-features-for-copilot-in-your-organization)."

[Submitting prompts](#submitting-prompts)
-----------------------------------------

You can ask Copilot Chat to give code suggestions, explain code, generate unit tests, and suggest code fixes.

1. To open the chat view, click the chat icon in the activity bar or press `Control`+`Command`+`i` (Mac) / `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`i` (Windows/Linux).
   
   ![](/assets/cb-312579/images/help/copilot/vsc-copilot-chat-icon.png)
   
   Tip
   
   For additional ways to access Copilot Chat, including inline with your code, see [Additional ways to access Copilot Chat](#additional-ways-to-access-copilot-chat) below.
2. Enter a prompt in the prompt box, or click one of the suggested prompts. For an introduction to the kinds of prompts you can use, see [Getting started with prompts for Copilot Chat](/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/guides-on-using-github-copilot/getting-started-with-prompts-for-copilot-chat).
3. Evaluate Copilot's response, and make a follow up request if needed.
   
   The response may contain text, code blocks, buttons, images, URIs, and file trees. The response often includes interactive elements. For example, the response may include a menu to insert a code block, or a button to invoke a Visual Studio Code command.
   
   To see the files that Copilot Chat used to generate the response, select the **Used *n* references** dropdown at the top of the response. The references may include a link to a custom instructions file. This file contains additional information that is automatically added to all of your chat questions to improve the quality of the responses. For more information, see [Adding custom instructions for GitHub Copilot](/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot).

[Using keywords in your prompt](#using-keywords-in-your-prompt)
---------------------------------------------------------------

You can use special keywords to help Copilot understand your prompt. For examples, see [Getting started with prompts for Copilot Chat](/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/guides-on-using-github-copilot/getting-started-with-prompts-for-copilot-chat).

### [Chat participants](#chat-participants)

Chat participants are AI domain experts that can perform tasks or answer questions in a specific domain.

Copilot Chat can infer relevant chat participants based on your natural language prompt, improving discovery of advanced capabilities without you having to explicitly specify the participant you want to use in your prompt. However, if you prefer, you can still manually specify a chat participant to scope your prompt to a specific domain. To do this, type `@` in the chat prompt box, followed by a chat participant name.

Note

Automatic inference for chat participants is currently in public preview and is subject to change.

Chat participants include:

* `@workspace`: Has context about the code in your workspace. Use `@workspace` when you want Copilot to consider the structure of your project, how different parts of your code interact, or design patterns in your project.
* `@vscode`: Has context about Visual Studio Code commands and features. Use `@vscode` when you want help with Visual Studio Code.
* `@terminal`: Has context about the Visual Studio Code terminal shell and its contents. Use `@terminal` when you want help creating or debugging terminal commands.
* `@azure`: Has context about Azure services and how to use, deploy and manage them. Use `@azure` when you want help with Azure. The `@azure` chat participant is currently in public preview and is subject to change.

In addition to the built-in Visual Studio Code chat participants, you can also install Copilot Extensions that provide chat participants. You can install these extensions from [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=apps&copilot_app=true) and from [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Chat&sortBy=Installs). For information about extensions from GitHub Marketplace that provide chat participants, see [Using extensions to integrate external tools with Copilot Chat](/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/github-copilot-extensions/about-github-copilot-extensions).

Note

GitHub Copilot Extensions is in public preview and subject to change.

To see all available chat participants, type `@` in the chat prompt box.

See also [Chat participants](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat#_chat-participants) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

### [Slash commands](#slash-commands)

Use slash commands to avoid writing complex prompts for common scenarios. To use a slash command, type `/` in the chat prompt box, followed by a command. Slash commands include:

* `/tests`: Generate unit tests for the selected code
* `/fix`: Propose a fix for problems in the selected code
* `/explain`: Explain the selected code
* `/clear`: Start a new chat

To see all available slash commands, type `/` in the chat prompt box. See also [Slash commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat#_slash-commands) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

### [Chat variables](#chat-variables)

Use chat variables to include specific context in your prompt. To use a chat variable, type `#` in the chat prompt box, followed by a chat variable. Chat variables include:

* `#file`: Include a specific file as context in the chat.
* `#git`: Include information about the current Git repository.
* `#terminalLastCommand`: Include the last run command in the active Visual Studio Code terminal.

To see all available chat variables, type `#` in the chat prompt box. See also [Chat variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat#_chat-variables) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

[Using GitHub skills for Copilot](#using-github-skills-for-copilot)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Note

This functionality is available with the Copilot Chat extension v0.20.3 or later and VS Code or VS Code Insiders 1.93 or later.

Copilot's GitHub-specific skills expand the type of information Copilot can provide. To access these skills in Copilot Chat in VS Code, include `@github` in your question.

When you add `@github` to a question, Copilot dynamically selects an appropriate skill, based on the content of your question. You can also explicitly ask Copilot Chat to use a particular skill. You can do this in two ways:

* Use natural language to ask Copilot Chat to use a skill. For example, `@github Search the web to find the latest GPT4 model from OpenAI.`
* To specifically invoke a web search you can include the `#web` variable in your question. For example, `@github #web What is the latest LTS of Node.js?`

### [Currently available skills](#currently-available-skills)

You can generate a list of currently available skills by asking Copilot: `@github What skills are available?`

The skills you can use in Copilot Chat in VS Code include those shown in the table below.

---------------------------------------------------------

Note

Multiple model support in Copilot Chat is in public preview and subject to change.

The following models are currently available through multi-model Copilot Chat:

* **GPT 4o:** This is the default Copilot Chat model. It is a versatile, multimodal model that excels in both text and image processing and is designed to provide fast, reliable responses. It also has superior performance in non-English languages. Learn more about the [model's capabilities](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o) and review the [model card](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-system-card/). Gpt-4o is hosted on Azure.
* **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** This model excels at coding tasks across the entire software development lifecycle, from initial design to bug fixes, maintenance to optimizations. Learn more about the [model's capabilities](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet) or read the [model card](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/61e7d27f8c8f5919/original/Claude-3-Model-Card.pdf). GitHub Copilot uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet hosted on Amazon Web Services.
* **o1:** This model is focused on advanced reasoning and solving complex problems, in particular in math and science. It responds more slowly than the `gpt-4o` model. You can make 10 requests to this model per day. Learn more about the [model's capabilities](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o1) and review the [model card](https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-system-card/). o1 is hosted on Azure.
