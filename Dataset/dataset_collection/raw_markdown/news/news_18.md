2. ### What we've heard from the airline and Boeing todaypublished at 10:47 Greenwich Mean Time10:47 GMT
   
   Let's have a look back at the communications that have come from plane manufacturer Boeing and Jeju Air, the airline involved in the crash this morning.
   
   In a statement, Boeing said: "We are in contact with Jeju Air regarding flight 2216 and stand ready to support them. We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew."
   
   Jeju Air have a black banner at the top of their website which reads: "We deeply apologize to all those affected by the incident. We will make every effort to resolve the situation. We sincerely regret the distress caused."
   
   Earlier today [Jeju Air bosses lowered their heads](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c4glr85l2ldt?post=asset%3A5bdd9341-b7cb-4fb2-b5de-d713db8bdfc5#post) during a media briefing in which they issued a public apology.

3. ### 'A lot of things about this tragedy don't make sense'published at 10:39 Greenwich Mean Time10:39 GMT
   
   A little earlier our colleagues on the news channel heard from Geoffrey Thomas, an aviation expert and commentator.
   
   He explains: "It appears as though there has been a bird strike and one of the engines, the right-hand engine was impacted. This would have caused a lot of pressure in the cockpit."
   
   He says that "with all the checking and cross-checking going on relating to this engine failure, it could well be that [the] pilots simply forgot to put the landing gear down".
   
   Pilots see warnings near Muan Airport at this time of year for flocks of mallard birds, which can be very large, Thomas says.
   
   ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/640/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2024/12/29/5dfc119d-1395-4702-9fc3-24dc5acd0c46.jpg.webp)
   
   Image caption, 
   
   A screengrab of Geoffrey Thomas as he spoke with the news channel
   
   
   
   But if the landing gear was not deployed, warnings would have sounded in the cockpit, he adds, and the undercarriage could be manually deployed if a problem prevented the landing gear from descending.
   
   "Whether the engine situation was such that they felt they didn't have time to do that we don't know," Thomas continues. "But they would have declared an emergency and therefore the firefighting units should have been runway-side" and should have prepared for a gear-up landing. Foam can also be laid on the runway in such a case.
   
   Thomas says that South Korea and its airlines are considered "industry best practice" - both the aircraft and the airline have an "excellent safety record".
   
   He adds: "A lot of things about this tragedy don't make sense."

4. ### Heartfelt condolences from world leaders - and South Korea's suspended President Yoonpublished at 10:32 Greenwich Mean Time10:32 GMT
   
   South Korea's suspended president, Yoon Suk Yeol, offered "deep condolences" to the families of those who died in the plane crash at Muan International Airport on Sunday.
   
   Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday sent condolences to the families of those killed in a deadly plane crash in South Korea.
   
   "We have received terrible news of a plane crash in South Korea with many fatalities. Our condolences go out to the families of those killed in the crash and we wish the injured a speedy recovery," he wrote in a post on social media platform X.
   
   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says: "On behalf of the Ukrainian people and myself, I extend heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families, the people of Korea, and Acting President Choi Sang-mok. We share your sorrow and stand with the Korean people in this time of grief."

5. ### Death toll now stands at 177published at 10:10 Greenwich Mean Time10:10 GMTBreaking
   
   The death toll has increased by one in the last few moments, meaning 177 have been confirmed dead after the crash.
   
   As a reminder, 181 people were on the plane in total - with two survivors having been taken to the hospital earlier.

6. ### A brief history of fatal aviation crashes in South Koreapublished at 10:06 Greenwich Mean Time10:06 GMT
   
   As we've been reporting, the plane crash at Muan International Airport [could be the worst aviation accident in South Korean](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c4glr85l2ldt?post=asset%3Af82285c7-f51c-4bfe-befb-cc37099cedc8#post) history. We've taken a look at other such crashes in South Korea:
   
   * **In 2002**, a Boeing 767-200 operated by Air China crashed into a hill near near South Korea's port city of Busan. The crash killed 129 people and injured 37.
   * **In September 1983**, a Korean Airlines Flight was shot down by a Soviet jet, after straying into Soviet airspace over Sakhalin island. All 269 people on board were killed.
   * **In 1997,** a Korean Air jumbo jet crashed on the Pacific island of Guam, killing 228 people out of the 254 people on board.
   
   The crash this morning is unusual for South Korea, which has had a good flight safety record in recent years, and this appears to be the only fatal crash that Jeju Air has had in its nearly 20 year history, writes BBC's Seoul correspondent Jean Mackenzie, who is at the scene of the crash at Muan Airport.

7. ### Pilot called Mayday after bird strike warning - transport officialspublished at 09:42 Greenwich Mean Time09:42 GMT
   
   A South Korean transport official earlier gave details about what happened to the plane as it approached the airport.
   
   * The plane had been attempting to land but then air traffic control gave a bird strike warning forcing the plane to hold off, the official says
   * About two minutes later, the pilot called a Mayday - and air traffic command gave permission for the plane to land from an opposite direction
   
   The pilot accepted - video shows the plane touched down without wheels or any other landing gear and skidded down the runway before crashing into a wall, causing a fiery explosion.
   
   The transport department notes that the head pilot had been in this role since 2019 and had more than 9,800 hours of flight experience.

8. ### Death toll rises to 176published at 09:33 Greenwich Mean Time09:33 GMTBreaking
   
   Officials now say the death toll has risen to 176. As a reminder, the plane was carrying 181 people, including 175 passengers and six crew members.
   
   Two people, both crew members, were rescued from the wreckage and taken to hospital. So far, authorities have identified 22 victims, news agency Yonhap reports.
   
   The National Fire Agency continues to update the death toll. This is a fast-moving story and we'll bring you the latest updates as we get them.

9. ### Authorities believe all passengers have diedpublished at 09:30 Greenwich Mean Time09:30 GMT
   
   The BBC's Jean Mackenzie is at the scene of the crash at Muan International Airport.
   
   She says it is now assumed that all the passengers on the plane have died, in the deadliest plane crash on South Korean soil. Two survivors - flight attendants that were located at the back of the plane - were taken to hospital.
   
   The passengers were returning from Thailand, where it is thought many of them had been on holiday over Christmas.

    In a statement, South Korea's National Fire Agency says the crash triggered the issuing of response level 3 - which means mobilisation is needed to scale up the response.
    
    More than 1,500 emergency personnel have been deployed to the site and a special disaster zone has been enforced.
    
    The statement, on X, continues: "We will do our best to rescue people and recover from the accident until the end."

    Witnesses that are speaking to South Korea's Yonhap news agency say they saw sparks and heard an explosion before the crash.
    
    Yoo Jae-yong, 41, who was staying near to the airport, tells Yonhap he saw a spark on the right wing shortly before the crash.
    
    Kim Yong-cheol, 70, tells the agency the plane failed to land initially and circled back to try again.
    
    Kim says he saw "black smoke billowing into the sky" after hearing a "loud explosion".
    
    "I saw the plane descending and thought it was about to land when I noticed a flash of light," another witness named Cho adds. "Then there was a loud bang followed by smoke in the air, and then I heard a series of explosions."

    Choi Sang-mok became acting president on Friday
    
    
    
    We heard a little earlier from acting president Choi Sang-mok, who held an emergency meeting in Seoul on Sunday and shortly after declared a special disaster zone in Muan.
    
    He only became leader of the country on Friday - the result of a political crisis that has gripped South Korea for the past three weeks.
    
    [Former acting president Han Duck-Soo](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj30234e0djo) was impeached on Friday. He was in the role for two weeks, stepping in after President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached by lawmakers on 14 December following [a disastrous attempt to impose martial law](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xj7kpe7kjo).
    
    Choi has now stepped into the breach. On Sunday he instructed his government to use all equipment and personnel available to rescue as many people as possible from the Jeju Air crash site.
    
    “We have a grave situation where a great loss of life occurred after a plane went off the runway in Muan airport," he said.
    
    "I express my deepest condolences to the many victims in the incident. I will do all I can for the injured to quickly recover."

    I’m outside the airport’s perimeter wall where the plane crashed when it overshot the runway.
    
    Above the wall you can see the blackened, charred tail of the plane. This is the only part of the aircraft still intact.
    
    Fire investigators say the plane’s body was so splintered by the explosion that it is unidentifiable.
    
    By the fence small fragments of the aircraft have been gathered up into a pile.
    
    Forensics officers are combing a nearby field looking for bodies as the sun sets.
    
    The fire has long been extinguished but the smell of burning still hangs in the cold air.

    A little earlier today, the Korea Railroad Corporation (Korail) issued a notice that they would run a temporary train between Seoul Station and Mokpo Station, about 17 miles (27km) from the airport. The free service will run for families of casualties, government officials and others who need to reach the site.
    
    Korail says the train will make stops along the route, including in Osong and Iksan.
