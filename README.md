###Akira.ai ðŸ¤–
###Intelligent Web-to-Markdown ML Pipeline

Convert messy web HTML into clean, LLM-ready markdown using ML-powered processing and intelligent web scraping.

Why Akira.ai?
Web scraping breaks on anti-bot detection. HTML is messy with ads and clutter. Manual cleaning doesn't scale.
Akira.ai solves this with:

Multi-engine scraping (Playwright, Selenium, undetected-chromedriver)
Anti-bot bypass and intelligent retry logic
Dual-stage HTML cleaning (html2text + markdownify)
ML-powered text processing using transformers (MiniLM-V6)
LLM integration for post-processing (Vertex AI, Hugging Face)


Features
âœ… Reliable Scraping - Multiple engines with anti-bot detection bypass
âœ… Clean Output - Transforms raw HTML into structured markdown
âœ… ML-Powered - Uses sentence transformers for semantic understanding
âœ… Docker Ready - Fully containerized for easy deployment
âœ… Multi-LLM Support - Integrate with OpenAI, Vertex AI, Hugging Face
âœ… 50+ Samples - Includes dataset of HTML/markdown pairs for testing

Tech Stack
Scraping: Playwright, Selenium, undetected-chromedriver, BeautifulSoup
ML/NLP: Transformers, sentence-transformers (MiniLM-V6), LangChain
Processing: html2text, markdownify, semchunk
LLMs: Vertex AI, Hugging Face, OpenAI, Mistral
Infrastructure: Docker, Python 3.11+

Use Cases
